            "In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, one of the most significant imperialist powers in the world was Great Britain. Though imperialism is ultimately a political concept, the values it promotes often seep into popular culture and society. This excerpt from 'Near The North Pole. A Journey with The Children's Encyclopaedia,' an article published in 1911 in Volume III of the monthly British children's encyclopedia Children's Magazine, provides an example of how British imperialists viewed the world.  The article is written in the style of a travelogue, a genre of writing that was common in colonialist cultures for its emphasis on eyewitness accounts of distant places.",
            "'Near The North Pole' describes the town of Barrow, Alaska, and the indigenous people that lived there at the time of the article's writing.  Though it was originally written with the intent of educating young readers about life in Alaska, the article now reveals far more about the imperialist values that were prevalent in British culture in the early 1900s.  Viewing certain groups and cultures as uncivilized or in need of external control was a common practice in imperialist societies.  Western imperialists had a long history of depicting the indigenous peoples they encountered while exploring the world as uncivilized.  This article paints indigenous Alaskans as a primitive group of people whose existence is merely a struggle for basic survival, and it uses outdated, offensive terms like 'eskimo' to refer to them.",
            "It is worth noting that although Alaska neighbored the British colony of Canada, it was never under British control.  Instead, Alaska was purchased by the United States from Russia in 1867.  Because of this, 'Near The North Pole' also reveals that British imperialists extended their mindset beyond the borders of their formal empire.  The article also briefly touches on American imperialism in Alaska through the missionaries and traders who have settled in Barrow."

            "But here is one from Barrow, Alaska.... 'The Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack flutter side by side,' observes one of the elders, 'near the source of the Yukon. Look at the boundary line separating Alaska from the far north-west of Canada. It follows a meridian from the Arctic Ocean, as if clean-cut with a knife, and just before reaching the Pacific it takes in a piece of the jagged coast, as if this end had been torn off. It is a pity that Great Britain did not take more interest in settling that boundary question, and a greater pity still that she did not buy Alaska when Russia offered it for sale in 1867. The United States bought this country, as large as Great Britain and Ireland, France and Spain taken together, for less than we now spend on a Dreadnought.'...",
            "There [is Point Barrow], on the extreme north, well within the Arctic Circle, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. There is a settlement here, a government station, where live in wooden houses, and chiefly on canned provisions, a few white folk, a missionary and his wife, a public school teacher, and some traders and their families—traders who have come to this faraway spot to trade in whale oil and bone and furs. One of these traders has a sister in England, who has sent him the Children's Encyclopaedia from its very beginning. And not only do his children get the benefit of it; it is the school-teacher of the United States school nearest the North Pole, who writes from Barrow, Alaska, to tell us how much his scholars, native Eskimo children, enjoy our magazine. [...]",
            "The forefathers of the Eskimo scholars at Barrow belong to a very ancient race. They have roamed along these bleak shores from times unknown, long, long before white men came, teaching them to drink fiery poison—bad whisky—and other white men followed to show the way to Christianity. There are not enough Eskimos in the whole of the Arctic shore from Greenland to Bering Straits to fill one of our large cities, and it is very difficult for us, used to comforts of every kind, to understand the conditions of their lives. We have to imagine a country without towns, roads, fields, trees, or hedges; a diet without milk, eggs, bread and butter, fruit or vegetables, puddings or sweets; homes without furniture or baths, and clothing that does not include cotton, wool, or silk! And we have also to understand that the Eskimos, in spite of all this, and the constant effort to ward off starvation, are a happy, contented people, loving their bleak country. If any Eskimos pass southwards to civilised life, they pine for the free, cold North, and the snow and ice, and the daring hard fight for existence. Many of them die if they cannot get back to it all quickly....",
            "Fine garments are [their] fur suits to keep out the cold. We note with special interest that some are from Point Barrow, and are amused to see that the women wear trousers like the men, and that the child's suit is just the same cut as its parent's. We see a mother's pride and care in the neat edge decorated with a line of fine white fur, and the handsome fringe, and the bead ornaments. The Eskimo women are very clever at making all these garments, as well as the comfortable-looking boots, and fur gloves, and useful waterproofs. In very cold weather a second suit is worn inside, with the fur turned inwards to the skin. The children running about must indeed look like baby buntings, though the tiny ones need but a few scraps of fur clothing, chiefly a cap, for they are kept—little fat, smiling, brown things—snug and warm in the fur hoods of their mother's curious-looking jackets...",
            "And the food! The bows and arrows, the spears and hatchets, the knives and scrapers of every kind, tell of the constant chase and hunt for food. The Eskimos live on raw meat and fish, cooked meat and fish, occasionally a few birds, wild berries, and a little moss in summer, and their whole life seems to be spent, from generation to generation, in one long struggle to get enough food by hunting and killing and cutting up the animals around them, their skins serving for clothing and bedding. Great is the courage and endurance of these people when hunting the whales and bears, the seals and walruses....",
            "It is said that it does not do to think too much about the Arctic regions, for if you do you may be drawn irresistibly to go there. It seems as if there must be some truth in this when we think of the undaunted explorers who go to the Arctic again and again, facing the hardships as cheerfully as the natives themselves. So we must not stop to watch the clever way in which the Eskimos play at cat's-cradle, or to look on at their greatly enjoyed dancing, or to listen to their soft, low songs. But we must give just a passing greeting to the white friends at Barrow as we leave the 'magnetic North,' hoping they will enjoy the parties to which their friends are coming from other settlements along the coast, and hoping, too, that they will have pleasant evenings playing games in each other's homes through the long night. How we should like to be there with them when the sun does rise again at last, and summer chases spring away almost before she has come!"

            "There is nothing like an editor's postbag, except actual travel, for giving one a real live interest in 'foreign parts.' Most of us have friends abroad whose letters give us that 'straight-from-you-to-me' feeling about a country we have never seen, which is the next best to visiting it ourselves. Since that letter came from the boys on the veldt, for instance, we have been able to see the rolling, bare country and feel the whistling wind. That large-hand letter from the little cousin in the far north-west of Canada—200 miles, she says, from the nearest dentist—opens up a vision of space and loneliness, of forests, mighty rivers and lakes, hard for us, who have so many near neighbours and houses over the way, to understand.",
            "Now the editor of the Children's Encyclopaedia, which finds its way to most of the countries under the sun, naturally has a postbag full of foreign letters, and the reading of them carries us in mind hither and thither to widely differing scenes.",
            "But here is one from Barrow, Alaska. Somehow these names do not bring up a clear picture in our minds. Alaska! What do we know about Alaska? 'A great country for fur,' says one, 'especially seal-skins.' 'People flock there for gold, and it's awfully cold,' says another. That reminds another that the golden river, the great Yukon, over 2,000 miles long, with its magnificent scenery, flows right through Alaska. 'The Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack flutter side by side,' observes one of the elders, 'near the source of the Yukon. Look at the boundary line separating Alaska from the far north-west of Canada. It follows a meridian from the Arctic Ocean, as if clean-cut with a knife, and just before reaching the Pacific it takes in a piece of the jagged coast, as if this end had been torn off. It is a pity that Great Britain did not take more interest in settling that boundary question, and a greater pity still that she did not buy Alaska when Russia offered it for sale in 1867. The United States bought this country, as large as Great Britain and Ireland, France and Spain taken together, for less than we now spend on a Dreadnought.'",
            "'Barrow, Alaska,' we read again, and to help us to a clear understanding of where this part of the world is, let us draw a sketch map of the Arctic Ocean, if we can, with a globe beside us. We mark first on our paper a dot for the North Pole, and, from that dot as a centre; draw a circle with a radius that stands for over 1,500 miles. This is the Arctic Circle, within whose limits the sun, at the height of summer, does not go to bed at all, and in the depth of winter never gets up. Now, this Arctic Circle will be a guide to us in sketching in the shores of the Arctic Ocean, where lies the beautiful and terrible palace of the mighty Ice King, so glittering white in the sunshine, so grey and dim in the long winter night under the brilliant stars and moon, except when revealed by the flashings of the Northern Lights.",
            "We show first on our map the wide-open door from the Atlantic to the Arctic, north of our own islands, leading by the east side of Greenland—the largest island in the world if we could Australia a continent—past Iceland, with its hot springs, and volcanic Hekla. We must not linger, gladly as we would do so, at the North Cape, where tourists go to see the marvel of the midnight sun, nor at the White Sea, with its memories of our sturdy forefathers in Tudor days; but we must hastily sweep our pencils round the long north coast of Asia, feeling very shivery the while, as we think of the cold rivers crawling to the frozen sea, and the icy cliffs in which monsters of old days have been imprisoned, whole and perfect for ages, and the utter poverty and misery of the few human beings who exist in this Northern Siberia. And then we come to what we may call the back door of the Arctic—from the Pacific—only forty miles wide, named, after the Russian explorer, Bering Straits. We see that there are stepping-stones across the water what separates Asia from America.",
            "We next fill in the northern shores of North America, indicate the numerous islands, show the side door, by the west of Greenland, by which Peary found his way to the Pole. Such are the boundaries of the Arctic Ocean, and enthralling are the stories that belong to every part of them. On strait, island, cape, are found the names of heroes who have dared to push their way in, either to discover the unknown or to try to find a near way, east or west, to the rich countries of Asia. Our next business is to finish drawing in Alaska, thick and black to make it stand out in our minds, ten times as large as England and Wales, at the other side of the world, farther west than Canada. We note the long tail of bare islands across the straits, and the countless islands along the Pacific coasts; we sketch in the golden Yukon, of which it is said that one cannot dip a pan in any part of its great length without getting at least the colour of gold; and we mark Sitka, the capital, and Nome, the centre of the goldfields near the coast. We would fain linger with the Indians in the forests, and see the towns and villages, and travel by one of the most wonderful railways in the world from the Pacific to the source of the Yukon. But our letter from Alaska is dated from Barrow—Point Barrow. There it is, on the extreme north, well within the Arctic Circle, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. There is a settlement here, a government station, where live in wooden houses, and chiefly on canned provisions, a few white folk, a missionary and his wife, a public school teacher, and some traders and their families—traders who have come to this faraway spot to trade in whale oil and bone and furs. One of these traders has a sister in England, who has sent him the Children's Encyclopaedia from its very beginning. And not only do his children get the benefit of it; it is the school-teacher of the United States school nearest the North Pole, who writes from Barrow, Alaska, to tell us how much his scholars, native Eskimo children, enjoy our magazine. Shall we, before we look into the faces of these fellow-readers, just glance over the route by which our magazine reaches them? Not by the direct North-west Passage, the straits of which are generally frozen and full of peril; but first it has to cross the Atlantic, the great engines of the ship going day and night for nearly a week, to reach New York. Then right across the huge continent it goes, speeding onwards by night and day in the train for nearly another week, and then by steamer from one of the Pacific ports, day after day, ever northwards, threading countless wooded islands, in sight of beautiful waterfalls and green hills, now passing under the shadow of stupendous mountains, down whose sides crawl immense glaciers, their ends breaking off with a noise like thunder as they launch into the sea—majestic icebergs. But the Barrow letters and parcels are still far from their destination, and may take many weeks to finish the journey in yet another vessel that may be going round into the Arctic. And as there is no regular post, not even once a month, several numbers will arrive together. Let us think of all this, we who get very impatient for our new Encyclopaedia each month as the fifteenth draws near!",
            "The forefathers of the Eskimo scholars at Barrow belong to a very ancient race. They have roamed along these bleak shores from times unknown, long, long before white men came, teaching them to drink fiery poison—bad whisky—and other white men followed to show the way to Christianity.

If any Eskimos pass southwards to civilised life, they pine for the free, cold North, and the snow and ice, and the daring hard fight for existence. Many of them die if they cannot get back to it all quickly.",
            "It will help us to form a picture of Eskimo life if we read the books of Arctic travel and adventure that come in our way, also if we revisit our old friends the Polar bears and seals at the Zoo, and try to imagine them in their crystal nurseries of the Far North, and if we study well the entrancing case of wild animals and birds against the white snow setting in the Natural History Museum. But, best of all, come to the corner of the long Ethnographical Gallery at the British Museum, at the top of the north-east staircase, where are set out the treasures of the Eskimos. We have to begin by thinking away the glass cases and the walls of the stuffy museum, and trying to see the things on the shores whence they come, in the cold, cold dark of winter, or in the too brief summer when the Ice King releases his grip, and the mosses grow green, and the reindeer come to eat them, and the little brown children joyfully pick the berries.",
            "Fine garments are those fur suits to keep out the cold. We note with special interest that some are from Point Barrow, and are amused to see that the women wear trousers like the men, and that the child's suit is just the same cut as its parent's.

The children running about must indeed look like baby buntings, though the tiny ones need but a few scraps of fur clothing, chiefly a cap, for they are kept—little fat, smiling, brown things—snug and warm in the fur hoods of their mother's curious-looking jackets.",
            "In the little model of a summer encampment, with its tent of skins weighted down by stones, the whole household, including the dogs, are shown busy at work, and we can see the baby just peeping out over its mother's shoulder. Winter homes are very different. Sometimes a pit is dug, and lined with any driftwood the sea brings to the shore, and the roof is made as close and snug as possible not far above the surface of the ground, being covered up with skins and clods of earth, with a warm, white blanket of snow on top. Another Eskimo dwelling is made of blocks of frozen snow, fitted together very neatly, one above the other, till the little house is the shape of a pudding-basin with its edge turned down. The door in every case is made as hidden and low as possible, to keep the 'lady in the cloak' out, to keep the wind and snow out, and to keep the warmth in. For day and night furniture, there is a bench of hard snow covered with skins, which are also used to line the walls. In the midst of this 'igloo,' as the house is called, burns the lamp that serves for light, warmth, and cooking. We can find one in the case, and are filled with wonder at the infinite care and patience—they have plenty of time in the Arctic— with which the stone is scooped out, with a ridge in which to tuck the moss that serves for a wick and a hollow for the oil. Above the lamp is fixed a lump of fat, which drips as it melts over the flame, and keeps it alight. We do not like to think of the smell of the lamp, nor the closeness of the 'igloo,' in which several people live, nor of the impossibility of washing when every drop of water has to be thawed. And the food! The bows and arrows, the spears and hatchets, the knives and scrapers of every kind, tell of the constant chase and hunt for food. The Eskimos live on raw meat and fish, cooked meat and fish, occasionally a few birds, wild berries, and a little moss in summer, and their whole life seems to be spent, from generation to generation, in one long struggle to get enough food by hunting and killing and cutting up the animals around them, their skins serving for clothing and bedding. Great is the courage and endurance of these people when hunting the whales and bears, the seals and walruses. We look closely at the boats above the cases in the British Museum—at the man's close canoe, at the woman's wider 'tub,' at the harpoons and floats, the needles and sinewy thread, the carved ivory walrus tusks, the flint 'strike-a-light,' and, perhaps most interesting of all, the toy animals, figures, and tools carved in bone and ivory, once handled with joy by chubby brown babies.",
            "Even the children are wonderfully expert in managing the boats, and they early learn the art of driving the dogs that drag the sledges by which long distances are travelled, and by means of which the successful hunters bring home the food and clothing. What rejoicing awaits their return, what feasting, what stories of old times, handed down and down, of hairbreadth escapes, and pluck in hunts long gone by! And if the stories run on, as they are sure to do, about the spirits that dwell in the shrieking blast, in the grinding ice, in the growling thunder, in the mysterious changing lights of the Aurora—well, no one has to go upstairs to bed alone in the dark; all go to rest where they are, round the lamp, the men's wet clothes drying in a net above it, and the children cuddling closely among the furs with their mothers. It is said that it does not do to think too much about the Arctic regions, for if you do you may be drawn irresistibly to go there. It seems as if there must be some truth in this when we think of the undaunted explorers who go to the Arctic again and again, facing the hardships as cheerfully as the natives themselves. So we must not stop to watch the clever way in which the Eskimos play at cat's-cradle, or to look on at their greatly enjoyed dancing, or to listen to their soft, low songs. But we must give just a passing greeting to the white friends at Barrow as we leave the 'magnetic North,' hoping they will enjoy the parties to which their friends are coming from other settlements along the coast, and hoping, too, that they will have pleasant evenings playing games in each other's homes through the long night. How we should like to be there with them when the sun does rise again at last, and summer chases spring away almost before she has come!"

            "Beginning in the sixteenth century, European powers, including England, bought slaves from Africa, mostly along the coasts, in the lucrative transatlantic slave trade. Though European countries began abolishing slavery in the nineteenth century, trade with Africa continued, with natural resources like ivory and palm oil in demand among Europeans. Like most European colonial powers, up until the 1870s British territory in Africa largely consisted of small stretches of land on the coasts, though large tracts of land in southern Africa had been under formal British control since the early 1800s. It was during the 1870s that the British and other European powers began expanding into more of Africa, driven by rumors of great wealth in the African interior, and made possible by the availability of new medicine like quinine to treat tropical diseases that would have otherwise prevented further expansion. Historians today call this the Scramble for Africa, as European countries competed against each other to claim land in Africa during the latter decades of the nineteenth century. In 1884, various European countries, including the United Kingdom, attended the Berlin Conference to settle colonial claims on land in Africa and divide the continent among themselves. Once competing claims were settled, the British Empire asserted control in their new African colonies.",
            "By 1908, the British Empire in Africa consisted primarily of crown colonies controlled by the British foreign office. Besides crown colonies there were also spheres of influence and protectorates, such as Egypt, overseen by the United Kingdom though officially under Ottoman sovereignty. Egypt was an important part of the British Empire, as the United Kingdom sought to maintain its hold over the Suez Canal. The native Africans living in the British Empire had few rights under British rule, and little say in how their land was governed.",
            "Within the British Empire in Africa, protestant missionaries evangelized indigenous populations to try to convert them to Christianity. These missionaries sought not only to convert Africans to the religion of the United Kingdom, but also sought to spread other parts of British culture and 'civilize' Africans; this included introducing Africans to European style clothing and manners. Colonial governments commonly gave support to the missionaries, seeing them as a means of exerting control over British Africa.",
            "When this encyclopedia entry was written, the initial phases of the Scramble for Africa were over, and the United Kingdom controlled a vast amount of land on the continent. Six years earlier, in 1902, the Second Boer War had ended with British victory over the Boer (descendants of Dutch and Huguenot settlers) South African Republic and Orange Free State. This allowed the British Empire to solidify its control over South Africa. This war was controversial in the United Kingdom, with British citizens dismayed over the high casualties their soldiers took, and reports of British cruelty against the Boers.",
            "This article from the 1908 British Children's Encyclopedia was written by British authors to be read by British children. These authors supported British imperialism and wanted to introduce young readers to imperialism in a way that would make them supportive of it. By describing native Africans as 'savages' and Europeans in Africa as having a positive impact on Africa, this article served to reinforce imperialist propaganda in the wake of recent controversies after the Second Boer War."

            "When you look at the map of the world, you will generally find that those parts of the earth's surface belonging to the British Empire are printed in red; and you will see that quite a large part of Africa is coloured red…Now, until about a hundred years ago there would have been no red patches—nothing more than some little red marks on the Guinea Coast. Before that the Dutch had planted a colony at the Cape of Good Hope, which is the country we mean when we speak of 'The Cape.' But other European nations had taken possession of stations on the coast only so that they might trade with the natives, and make an expedition now and then inland. It did not seem worth while to do more, because these places were terribly hot and horribly unhealthy ; and people who tried to go inland found it hotter and more unhealthy. Besides which, the natives were all savages, with whom there was not much trading to be done. So that very little indeed was known about Africa——except Egypt and the countries which lie along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.",
            "But things are very different now, for during the second half of the nineteenth century several bold travellers, many of them Christian missionaries, made exploring expeditions, and did their best to make friends with the natives… And so it was found out that if Europeans set about the business in the right way some good might be got out of Africa after all. Therefore, the nations of Europe made agreements together that, instead of fighting each other to get the biggest share, each should have a settled portion, which is called a Sphere of Influence, in which it might do pretty much what it liked as long as it did not interfere in the sphere of influence of someone else, and did not break certain rules which everyone feels to be just and necessary in the treatment of the natives. […]",
            "So there are three divisions of those parts of Africa which belong to the British Empire. First, there are the little portions on the Guinea Coast,which have been British for a long time, but have had more territory added to them. Then there is the nose, in the south, where there are a great many white people; and, thirdly, there are the lands in the interior which are in the British sphere of influence, where there are not many white people yet, and perhaps never will be—at any rate, until we can find out some way of preventing them from getting diseases which are much more fatal to Europeans than to races which have lived in tropical climates for hundreds or thousands of years. But we have been there only a very short time as yet, so that we may still find out ways of making it more possible to go on living there. Africa is so big, and there is still so much of it where only a very few white men have ever been, that explorers still go on finding new sorts of animals; and people who like adventures go there to hunt 'big game,' which means big beasts that are dangerous. [...]",
            "[The] African races are not like the people of India, who have been civilised for thousands of years, though their civilisation is different from that of the peoples of Europe. The Africans have hardly been civilised at all; they have not tried to make themselves skilful in anything except things that have to do with fighting and hunting. They never thought of building themselves anything better than what we should call huts to live in, or of making any but the roughest kind of tools, and even now they have learned very little from the Europeans. If they were left to themselves, they would wear hardly any clothes. In those parts of the country where they have a good deal to do with Europeans, many of them have been taught Christianity; but most of them are still heathen, and believe more in what we should call witchcraft or magic than in anything else; and even now, where there are no Europeans to stop them, some of them are cannibals."

            "The Ottoman Empire ruled Palestine for over four centuries. During the period of Ottoman rule, the Palestinian region was structured into three districts, Jerusalem, Gaza, and Nablus, which were all connected to the Damascus Province. By the mid-1800s, the Ottoman Empire had established strong economic relations with the British Empire. The 1838 Treaty of Balta Liman allowed British merchants full access to all Ottoman markets and taxed them at the same rate as local merchants. The Ottoman Empire agreed to Balta Liman treaty in exchange for military assistance from the British. The Ottomans were fighting a rebel governor, Muhammad Ali, whose forces were positioned to take over the capital at Constantinople. The Balta Liman treaty marked the beginning of informal British imperialism, or a 'sphere of influence,' within the Ottoman Empire. Still, the British remained in competition with France, Russia, and Germany for economic influence in the Ottoman world. This dynamic enabled the Ottoman Empire to navigate international affairs with little restrictions by leveraging one major power against another. By the early 1900s, political problems within the Ottoman Empire had become a serious concern of the British Empire and its allies. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 completed the emergence of Turkish and Arab nationalism and accelerated Ottoman modernization. Not everyone was happy with these radical changes. Mounting tensions between various religious and ethnic groups threatened the social, political, and economic stability of the Ottoman Empire.",
            "In 1911, a travelogue entitled, 'The Homeland of Jesus. Life and Scenes in Palestine To-Day,' was published in volume two of The New Children's Encyclopaedia by edited by British journalist and imperialist, Arthur Mee. The travelogue depicts the view of 1911 Ottoman Palestine from the perspective of a British imperialist. As the title suggests, religion (particularly Christianity) plays a central role in this travelogue. Historical Palestine was and continues to be important to Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Several important religious sites are located in modern-day Israel and Palestine, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Western Wall. This travelogue frames the trip to Ottoman Palestine as an English Protestant's spiritual pilgrimage, considering every location visited is a religious site. The author's portrayal of Jews, Christians, and Muslims is informed by an imperialist and Biblical understanding of historical Palestine and its people. The author depicts Arabs as exotic and mysterious, whereas Christians and Jews are revered and glorified. The excerpt below illustrates this British imperialist view of Ottoman Palestine in the early twentieth century."

As we go through the various churches and chapels belonging to the Greek, Latin, Armenian, and Coptic churches, we hear a constant hum of prayers and litanies, drowned from time to time by the rolling of an organ, the clash of a cymbal.

We are amazed at the magnificence in form and decoration of this shrine, to enter which we take off our shoes. Such blue Persian tiles and mosaic glass, such beautiful arches and pillars and soft carpets. The El-Aksa Mosque—El-Aksa means 'the most distant'—the farthest sacred shrine from Mecca, stands about 500 feet away from the Dome of the Rock. It was first a Christian cathedral, but was changed by Omar into a mosque. We linger as long as we can over the view from the walls, and the endless points of interest and beauty which it contains.",

Thousands of Jews are gathering now in the country that once belonged to their forefathers, which they still love with a passionate patriotism. On certain days a most affecting service is held beside a part of the wall surrounding the Temple enclosure, a part believed to date from Solomon's time. With faces pressed against the huge stones, the Jews bewail the lost glories of their Temple and country, and pray and read the Hebrew Scriptures with the tear streaming down their faces. […]",

We grow quite dazed as we are taken from site to site, and are told that here our Savior was crowned with thorns, here He was nailed to the Cross. There He was buried. How can there be so much certainty about it, we reflect. Helena's chair and chapel remind us of the dream of the empress, by which she is said to have been guided to find the true Cross on this spot. That was three centuries after Christ's death and the awful destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans some years after, and during those centuries neither Jew nor Christian came to this place, and men's memories grew dim about the exact position of the spots where Jesus suffered. Helena's beautiful church was destroyed by the Persians, and many were the buildings and additions, many were the fires, many were the fierce fights raging round, through the Crusading times and onwards.",
            "We feel it a welcome relief to pass out to the open air from the crowded buildings, churches, convents, galleries, altars, rival sects, and to make our way by the Damascus Gate to a remarkably shaped mound, with bare limestone cliffs. It can indeed be seen from 'afar off,' and there must have been many 'passersby' near this little Hill of Execution, where two ancient main roads cross.",
            "Not far from this spot, which many believe to be the true Calvary, is a quiet garden, lately cleared from rubbish and set in order by English folk. With deep interest we look at the tombs in the garden, especially at one that answers to one described in the Gospels. We feel that it is this mound, this garden tomb, we shall bear in mind when we are at home again singing of the 'green hill far away, without a city wall' rather than the far-famed, much - fought - for sites revealed by the dream of Helena, which are now under the buildings of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.",
            "Next day comes our visit to Bethlehem. It is an easy drive, five miles to the south of Jerusalem. The Field of the Shepherds attracts us first, we only wish we could have been in them at night, under the brilliant starlit sky. As it is, we enjoy the sunshine on the fields where Ruth gleaned after the reapers of Boaz, on the shining white buildings of the little city standing out against the blue sky, on the broad plain stretching to the Dead Sea, with the purple mountains of Moab gleaming in the distance.",
            "Foremost among the sights of Bethlehem stands out the large and simple Church of the Nativity, whose building was be- gun about 1,600 years ago over the spot where Christ was born.",
            "The little inn in which Mary and Joseph sought shelter was on the old caravan route, and no doubt the stable to which they were turned was in a rocky cave close by, as many inn stables are seen to-day. The rocky cave- stable said to be the one is now a shrine lined ancient church has well-nigh involved Europe in war! Our next pilgrimage takes us farther afield from Jerusalem, two days' travelling in a carriage, some of it over very rough roads. We start early, out by the Damascus Gate, winding past the Garden Tomb, across the brook Kedron, past the Garden of Gethsemane to the slopes of Olivet. Jerusalem looks lovely in the morning sun, over the steep valley dotted with Jewish graves. Above the striking city walls we see the greenish lustre of the wonderful dome built over the Temple site, and the towers with marble, lit by lamps burning night and day, supplied n by the different n churches that have shares in the various parts of the building. We stoop to read the inscription round the silver star on — the floor: 'Here Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary.'",
            "Turkish soldiers keep guard, as in Jerusalem, to prevent the followers of the Prince of Peace flying at each others' throats over a few inches of a wall or altar. It has been said that more than once the question of the opening or shutting of a door in the churches and convents that have clustered round the and spires all crowded against the sky. Bethany is close at hand in a hollow. The supposed sites of the tomb of Lazarus and the home of Mary and Martha are shown in the village, but we are content to stand on the edge of hollow, and imagine ourselves gazing with Mary down the mountain, watching and longing for her Friend in her sore trouble. The view onwards is fine, in the clear, bright air; was it here spoken, am the Resurrection and the Life, 'the words still echoing down the years to comfort those who have lost their dear ones?'",
            "And now we go down, down, down to the Jordan valley, by zigzag roads as in Swiss mountain passes. It is a steep drop from the heights of Jerusalem, and we get many views of the wonderful deep valley in which the Jordan winds on its way from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea. The distance between the seas, as the crow flies, is only seventy miles, but so great are the windings of the Jordan that its course is nearly three times as long. There is a beautiful harmony between the green of the willows and rushes that border the river and the blue of the calm Dead Sea. It is a hot, rough journey as we near the sea, over a mere track among little mounds of mud and low scrubby bushes, that serve as food for camels.",
            "Greatly do we enjoy a rest on the pebbly beach, and still more a bathe in the far-famed salt water, seven times salter than the ocean. This saltness is realised when we get a drop in our eyes or mouth. We feel ourselves so light in the Dead Sea that we simply stand up- right when out of our depth and tread water. We find it best to swim on our backs, as it is not easy to keep our arms and legs under water.",
            "Invigorating as it is, we are glad of a dip later in the fresh water of the Jordan to wash off the salt that has dried on our skin. We lunch under the green trees by the river, and listen to the stories of our guide about the thousands of pilgrims, chiefly Russians, who come to bathe in the waters of Jordan, the river crossed by the children of Israel on their way to the Promised Land ; the river in which John baptised his Master. We seem to see the happy, merry folk, so simple and kindly, so enthusiastic about all they see and hear. They carry away the garments wetted by Jordan water, and keep them to be buried in, for this pilgrimage is the event of their lives.",
            "We spend the night at Jericho, the lowest inhabited spot in the world. Nearly all the course of the Jordan is below the level of the sea ; the surface of the Dead Sea is nearly 1,300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. The Old Testament Jericho, so wonder- fully besieged and taken, and the New Testament Jericho, where blind Bartimasus begged, and Zacchteus collected taxes, are both marked now by rubbish- heaps and ruins. It is on the site of the Jericho of Crusading times that the modern village stands, surrounded by gardens and groves of fruit-trees.",
            "It is a long climb back to Jerusalem. The pilgrims do it on foot; so did the multitudes who went out to hear and see the Baptist by the Jordan.",
            "Before starting for Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee, we must visit the south-east part of Jerusalem, where the famous Temple of Solomon stood. The site is now covered by magnificent Mohammedan buildings and courts. Some think that the rock on its highest point, which is covered by the Dome of the Rock, was the Altar of Burnt Offering. We are amazed at the magnificence in form and decoration of this shrine, to enter which we take off our shoes. Such blue Persian tiles and mosaic glass, such beautiful arches and pillars and soft carpets. The El-Aksa Mosque—El-Aksa means 'the most distant'—the farthest sacred shrine from Mecca, stands about 500 feet away from the Dome of the Rock. It was first a Christian cathedral, but was changed by Omar into a mosque. We linger as long as we can over the view from the walls, and the endless points of interest and beauty which it contains.",
            "Our last sight in Jerusalem has a haunting sadness. Thousands of Jews are gathering now in the country that once belonged to their forefathers, which they still love with a passionate patriotism. On certain days a most affecting service is held beside a part of the wall surrounding the Temple enclosure, a part believed to date from Solomon's time. With faces pressed against the huge stones, the Jews bewail the lost glories of their Temple and country, and pray and read the Hebrew Scriptures with the tear streaming down their faces.",
            "And now begins the most adventurous part of our journey. We might do it easily by taking train from Jerusalem back to Jaffa, thence fifty miles northward by steamer to Haifa, and then by carriage to Nazareth. But for many reasons—chiefest that we want to live in the great past, see the views that Jesus saw, see the peasants as He saw them— we decide to take the land journey by carriage to Nablous, and then to Nazareth on horseback.",
            "It is a wonderful farewell view we get of Jerusalem as we mount the hill to the north and look back at the panorama; and then all day long we pass over rough hills and beautiful valleys, over rocky passes with bright streams, over fertile fields. With bewildering rapidity we leave behind us sites connected with David, Samuel, Eli, Joshua and his followers. We sleep at Nablous, the old city of Shechem, the first city (Sichem) mentioned in the Bible. Here live the remnant—only some 200 poor folk—of the old Samaritans, and in their interesting synagogue we see the famous and ancient roll of the books of Moses and Joshua.",
            "The Vale of Shechem is grandly walled in by two mountains, one dry and bare, with masses of prickly pear, the other, at its base, clothed with lovely flowers and shrubs, and gay with leaping brooks. We turn aside to see Jacob's Well, where Christ, weary with the heat, sat and rested and talked with the woman of Samaria. It is hard riding next day, though our Arab steeds bring us safely through, with guides and attendant horsemen to look after us.",
            "The Kings of Israel did indeed find a grand site for their new capital, towering on its lonely hill, rising from broad and fertile plains. We take in as much as we can of the position of Ahab's ivory palace, of the ruins of the grand colonnade, of the magnificent views all round. What wild and stirring scenes once raged where now sad ruin and desolation brood over the Hill of Samaria! Presently our way takes us across the Vale of Dothan, and as we go we live again in the familiar story of Joseph, and watch the dreamer coming over the fields to his brothers. We shudder at their treatment of the boy as we look into the old rock-cut bottle-shaped cisterns, into one of which he may have been let down, and, in that cloud of dust out yonder, we almost fancy we can see the caravan of Ishmaelites to whom he was sold, treveiling on the ancient highway we are crossing. It is still a principal trade route between the Euphrates and Egypt. As we cross the plain of Esdraelon we realise that we are in the very heart of a great battlefield where men have striven with each other from the times of Sisera to those of Napoleon.",
            "As the eventful day closes, the last ridge is crossed, and we are at Nazareth.",
            "Next day we spend some happy hours among the rocky fields around, picking the 'lilies of the field,' watching the birds, and the boys tending sheep and goats. Things change here so little through the centuries that we have little difficulty in seeing them as they were 2,000 years ago. Here are women grinding at the mill, travellers in flowing g garments with scrip and staff, oxen ploughing, people living on the housetops, men carrying water in 'bottles' made of the skins of animals. Our chief interest in Nazareth is to watch the mothers and children at the well, now called the Virgin's Well, in memory of the days when Mary came to it with her pitcher, holding her little Son by the hand.",
            "Next day the carriage takes us on past Cana and the Hill of Blessings, and then at last we look down on the blue and sparkling Sea of Galilee, ringed round with green hills. We greatly enjoy a sail on the lake, seeing the spot where the Jordan enters strong and full into it, and noting on its shores the ruins of the old towns with familiar names that were dotted about it in the time of Christ. Ships and boats were busy then on its waters, plying from one to the other; the fishermen, too, had good markets for their abundant hauls of fish. In the early morning, next day, we cross it again from Tiberias, and amid the quiet ripple of the little waves we think of the scenes on its shores, of the storms, of the words borne across the water, 'It is I, be not afraid.'",
            "From Semakh we take the train to Damascus, a journey of a few hours. Such varied scenery we pass, picturesque river valleys, pools of hot sulphur, bare plains dotted with the mounds of buried cities, and fine views from time to time of the snowy giant, Mount Hermon, whence springs the Jordan. The last part of the way is over the Damascus-Mecca Railway, by which thousands of pilgrims now travel toward the birthplace of Mohammed. The buildings of the city, of a pearly grey colour, surrounded by thousands of the greenest trees, have gained for it the name of the 'pearl set in emeralds.' It is also called the Immortal City, the oldest city in the world, for Damascus was full of people, thriving and beautiful, long ages before Rome was born.",
            "We feel we would like many weeks, instead of days, in which to wander by the two rivers that 'make' the fertile site of Damascus. In the bazaars we are delighted with things old and new which show the skill of the people from early days in metal and leather work and in beautiful damask linen and hangings.",
            "But we must tear ourselves away to visit the Great Mosque, for about it hangs the story of the lovely city from the days when Naaman, the Syrian captain, gained permission to bow himself in the House of Rimmon, and onward through Roman and Christian times.",
            "It is but a short journey by train to visit the grand ruins of the Temple of the Sun and of Bacchus, and the stupendous quarries of stone at Baalbek, in the plain between the two Lebanon ranges. Columns are still standing 90 feet high, immense flights of steps are still to be seen, and remains of huge terraces and walls.",
            "By the old road that leads from Baalbek to the cedars of Lebanon, the traveller has to climb a pass 8,000 feet above the level of the sea, whence the view is superb, over snowy peaks, over mountain streams and valleys, far away to the Mediterranean on the one side, and to the desolate distant ridges on the other. The cedars, grand and dreary as they are, some of them perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 years old, are but a remnant of the forests so famous in the days of Solomon.",
            "But we have to take the train from Baalbek to the port of Beyrout, across the Lebanon range, and a most beautiful journey it is. The highest point is nearly 5,000 feet above the sea, and the railway descends in zigzags through pine-forests. As we look out from the train, we think we have seen nothing more beautiful in all our tour than the views over the Mediterranean in the afternoon sun.",
            "We approached the Holy Land in the golden haze of sunrise ; we leave it in shadow as we face the setting sun."

            "In the early twentieth century, Persia (also known as Iran) witnessed changing relations with British Empire, as the latter established a sphere of influence in the region. Persia is bordered to the east by India, which was a significant British colony at the time, making Persia a gateway into that land. So, for the British, establishing a military outpost in the Persian Gulf was of high strategic importance. The path to a British sphere of influence in Persia was complicated. In 1856 a war broke out between the two nations when the Persians invaded Afghanistan. Seeing this as a threat to their control of the region, the British entered hostilities with the Persians, culminating in their victory the following year. Persia ended up losing sovereignty over several regions as a result. This did not secure lasting British influence, however, due to the interference of the Russian Empire.Instead, an imperial contest emerged between the two empires that occupied the last half of the nineteenth century in what is known as the 'Great Game.' Both empires competed with each other to secure spheres of influence in Central Asia, including Persia. The Great Game concluded in 1907 with the compromise of Russia obtaining influence in northern Persia and the British controlling southern Persia. This widely benefited the British because, a year later, oil was discovered. Seizing the opportunity, British interests struck oil at Masjid i-Suleiman in southern Persia on May 26, 1908, with the backing of the Burmah Oil Company. Two years later, the Burmah Oil Company formed a subsidiary to manage oil production in Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which today is British Petroleum (BP).",
            "The following excerpt comes from an encyclopedia article written during the years that British interest in Persia was increasing due to the discovery of oil. It was published in Arthur Mee's encyclopedia for children living in the British Empire which aimed to teach them about various subjects in the world. In this context, the article depicts Persia through an imperialist lens. Subsequently, this document is an excellent primary source for the study of imperialism around 1900. It gives us insight into the mentality that pro-imperialist Britons had of faraway, non-Western lands like Persia. It refers to Persian empires during antiquity and in the last several hundred years but emphasizes how they sank back into obscurity, likely referring to their defeat by the British in 1857. It portrays Persia as a desolate place where people live in villages and while it does mention beautiful, historic Persian cities like Isfahan ('Ispahan' below], it paints the rest of Persia as a wasteland."

            "How the Land of the Moslem Conquerors Sank Back Into Obscurity. In Persia the long centuries of crushing dependence came to an end when the Mongol rule gave way to a national government under Ismail, early in the sixteenth century. He took the old Persian title of shah. It was not long before progress was made in enlarging the borders of the kingdom towards Georgia and Mesopotamia. Queen Elizabeth sent envoys from England, hoping to open up trade and gain a footing in the East. The greatest of the Persian shahs, Shah Abbas, ruled in those days, and he not only extended his dominions, but did much to promote prosperity within them. He made roads and bridges, practically rebuilt the beautiful city of Ispahan, encouraged the silk industry for which Persia had been famous in the past, and furthered trade with Russia. Persian troops, in conjunction with an English fleet in the Persian Gulf, drove the Portuguese from their settlement at Ormuz. Pearl fisheries are still carried on in the Persian Gulf, and most of the ships on these waters are British.",
            "The Fall of Persia From its Great Power To Its Present Weakness Before long, new enemies threatened Persia. The Afghans, a practically independent people on the Indian frontier, boldly laid siege to Ispahan, which they entered in triumph. For many years there were bitter quarrels about the form of Mohammedanism that should be followed and about the succession to the throne. At the end of the eighteenth century the capital was transferred to Teheran; and the kingdom, little by little, lost its western provinces. Russia crept over the Caucasus and annexed part of Armenia; the land east of the Caspian also fell under the influence of Russia.",
            "We have, perhaps, a general idea of the strong contrasts of Persia; of the wide-spreading deserts, crossed by caravans, carrying silks and carpets, dates, and embroideries to the ports on the Caspian and Black seas; of the fertile patches, or oases; of the far-scattered towns. We now want to see everything closer, to meet the people, and understand, as far as we can, how absolutely different Persia is from anything we know in the West. Railways not being available, for there are at present only two short lines, let us join in imagination an adventurous motor-car party, determined to penetrate to Ispahan, join in the very heart of Persia. It needs some courage, for the roads are generally bad, and accommodation and food are very poor.",
            "A Garden In the Midst of a Dreary Desert: At last we see the domes of the mosques of Ispahan between the trees, and turning from the bare mountains in the distance, which now look as if bathed in gold, we do not know what to enjoy most. The avenues of trees, the fields of roses and white poppies, the gardens, the pale green streams and canals, the buildings of the great Shah Abbas, which date from the end of the sixteenth century—everything is wonderful and interesting. The enamelled tiles and plaques, the blue cupolas and minarets of the mosque, the fine square, all fill us with admiration; and there are also the immense bazaars, where we can buy everything under the sun, and where potters, and weavers of cashmeres and carpets, and leather-workers are. all following their interesting and useful trades."

It provides a vivid portrayal of the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), an era in China's history marked by seismic shifts and challenges as the nation transitioned from centuries of isolation to engaging with the wider world.",
            "As the narrative progresses, it delves into the geopolitical landscape of the time, where Britain secured control over Hong Kong in 1841, and began exerting significant influence over mainland China after winning victory in the First Opium War (1839-1842). Much of Qing China, though not directly governed by foreign empire, found itself coerced into adopting foreign policies, resulting in the loss of numerous historically significant artifacts to external powers. The historical account also sheds light on the detrimental impact on Chinese society of the opium trade, forcibly imposed by the British against the Qing rulers' wishes, leaving an enduring scar on the nation's history. The account takes a turn with the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, a desperate internal Chinese response against both the Qing state and the perceived intrusion of Western missionaries and foreigners. The vivid description of the Boxers' two-month siege of Peking (today: Beijing) encapsulates the perilous existence of European residents in the Chinese capital and the eventual intervention of Allied forces.", "This historical narrative serves as a poignant reminder of the intricate and multifaceted evolution of China—a tale of triumphs, tribulations, and the profound impact of external influences on a society grappling with the delicate balance between tradition and progress. It illuminates the complexities of a nation in inconstancy, navigating the challenges of a changing world while trying to preserve its rich cultural heritage."

            "These first years of China's awakening after the long, numbing sleep of centuries have, indeed, been full of trouble and pain. There have been almost incessant wars with the neighbours who could no longer be kept out, with Russia, France, Germany, Japan, and during these wars China has learnt by sad experience that her old ways of warfare, though picturesque in their setting, and almost sacred from long custom, were useless against those of her opponents. Now Chinese troops are drilled by Western methods.", "Naturally there has been much feeling against all the new ideas in this most conservative country in the world; the first railways were torn up as soon as laid; telegraphs were bitterly opposed, and Christian missionaries always carried their lives in their hands. So greatly have they been hated, in spite of the ability and devotion they have shown, especially in organising relief in times of dreadful famine and plague, that in 1900 a great rising—called the Boxer rising—took place, against the missionaries at first, but eventually all the hated foreigners were attacked. For two terrible months the European residents in China were in great danger.Many were killed, and others suffered all the terrors of a siege. They were shut up in Peking, with a howling mob eager for their lives outside, till relief came, and the Boxers were driven away. The allied forces made their way to Peking, and the emperor and his aunt fled far westward.", "The efforts of Christian missionaries in China have been sadly hampered by the actions of traders of their own faith, by their want of principle, and by the bad example that many of them have set. Great wrong has been done in the past by Englishmen in furnishing, for the sake of money, arms and help to the rebels who were devastating China when Gordon came to the rescue, and by their insisting on sending into China the poisonous drug opium, against the wishes of the rulers; this also for the sake of gain. The smoking of opium has quite as bad an effect on people as taking too much strong drink—it destroys them body and mind, and it has been a terrible curse to China. Strong efforts are now being made to persuade people to give up the habit that is so easy to form, and so very difficult to break."

          "paragraph": ["The Empire of China covers one quarter of Asia, from the Pamirs to the Pacific, and from Siberia to India. The mysterious and wonderful mother country, China proper, lies between its great provinces of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Turkestan, and the vast Pacific Ocean. In size China proper is about twelve times larger than the British Isles, and its face is crossed by the outlying eastward ranges of mountains running from the great central heights, and by the immense rivers fed by the snows of Obet, and joined by a network of streams on their long journey to the ocean.", "It is estimated that over 300,000,000 people live in China, in its great cities and fertile plains, and on the banks of its waterways.", "Among the treasures of nearly every home in England are to be found curiosities brought by sailor friends and relations from this wonderland of the Far East, such as delicate embroideries in shining silks of gorgeous colours, dainty carvings in ivory, and exquisite little bits of fine porcelain or china. And as we have looked closely at the regular stitches in the beautiful fabric, we have seen that there is no untidy 'wrong side' in Chinese work. We have wondered at the seemingly impossible puzzle of the ivory balls carved one inside the other, or at the unusual patterns on the thin little cups, and we have tried to picture to ourselves the far country whence the treasures came, and the patient and clever workers who made them. Perhaps all that we have succeeded in calling before our minds is the strange hairdressing of Chinese men, and the tiny feet of Chinese women, upon a misty background of an unknown land of flowers, with gracefully curved buildings and willow-pattern plate landscapes.", "If we have gone to our map of China for help, very possibly we have been dismayed and discouraged by the great number of difficult names upon it, and queer ones indeed they seem to us, in a language so absolutely different from our own. So perhaps it will help us in our quest of a closer view of China and its people to learn a few words of Chinese first, and then, at any rate, we shall understand what some of the names mean, which will give us a much better chance of remembering them, difficult as they are. In this veritable Land of Mighty Streams, ho, kiang, and kong, all mean river ; chan, or shan, and ling, stand for the mountains between which the rivers run, or through which, in some parts, they force a way between mighty gorges; pe, nan, tong, or tung, and si, indicate the points of the compass, north, south, east, and west; hoang, or hwang, is yellow, the imperial colour of China ; pei, is white; fu, or foo, and king, mean town or court; hai, the sea ; chian, heaven, and so on.", "Knowing a few words like these, we can easily find the mountains of the east, north, and south : Shan-tung, and the Pe-ling and Nan-ling ranges. The two last shut in the basin of China's greatest and most important river, the Yang-tse-kiang. Over 3,000 miles lie between its sources in the heights of Tibet and its mouth in the Pacific Ocean. It makes a magnificent water- way into the heart of the country, wide and deep enough for steamers to ply for a thousand miles through the rich plains of Central China, which the river itself has done much to form, by bringing down fertile mud, as the Nile does along its banks in Egypt.", "In its upper courses, separated from the lower by grand gorges which remind us of the Iron Gate on the Danube, it passes through a rich district of red earth—as large as England and very thickly peopled. There are lakes in the basin of the Yang-tse-kiang which act as reservoirs in the time of heavy rains, so that its floods are not so disastrous as those on the Hwang-ho, or Yellow River, which drains through Northern China. 'China's Sorrow' is one of the names of this river, so dreadful are the floods when it bursts its banks and submerges the surrounding country and towns. It is not navigable for long distances, like the Yang-tse-kiang, but on its banks, and in caves in its cliffs, live many of China's millions.", "Water is not the only gift the inland provinces send to the mother country; another is sand—yellow' sand—that has been constantly blown by the strong winds from Mongolia over parts of Northern China for centuries, till valleys have been filled up by deep beds of it, and the low hills covered with it. So here we have a yellow land with a yellow river, cutting its way through the soft soil, making deep cliffs on each side, and carrying its thick, yellow, sandy waters onw'ards, until they pour by ever-changing mouths into a yellow sea. One of the titles of the great Emperor of China is 'Lord of the Yellow Land.'", "The yellow basin of North China is even more fertile than the red basin of Central China, several valuable crops being raised in a year on the 'loess' soil, as it is called.", "The Si-kiang, or West River, drains Southern China, rising in the eastern spurs of the Tibetan heights, and making its way through tropical forests, past mountains with treasures of every sort of mineral, and fields with crops that require a hot and moist climate. It is from Southern China principally that so many Chinese emigrate to find work in different parts of the coast of the wide Pacific.", "We have often imagined the hum that rises from busy districts and towns in other countries, but from China—• from that vast hive of human industry between the solemn, silent central mountains and the deep, wide sea—it seems as if there must be one continuous and mighty buzz from the whole country, so close are the great cities, so many are the millions of people living and working on the fertile plains.", "And this buzz of multitudes is no new thing, as it is in our own country, where great industrial centres are scarcely a century old; neither is it caused, as it is with us, by the whir and thump of machinery and the noise of the iron horse on his journeys to every corner of the land. Railways and machinery are, comparatively speaking, only just starting in China, the oldest living empire in the world.", "The land of eternal sameness where customs never change", "For thousands of years her people have been steadily working, growing in numbers and changing rulers, suffering the horrors of war and enjoying the blessings of peace, but always busy in the same old ways, making the same things, cultivating the ground on the same methods for centuries, learning the same lessons in the same language, and competing in the same examinations to fill the same Government posts.", "It is difficult for us who are all for progress and new ideas, and dislike standing still, to understand this steady keeping to old ways. Two thousand years ago our ancestors were still in the wilds of Germany—very rough persons, who would find us, their descendants, very much changed in language, manners, and dress from themselves", "Now, the written history of China goes back for 4,000 years—more than twice as long as ours—so that when Europe was just beginning to make for civilised ways and thoughts, the Chinese nation was as old as we are now. But she lost the advantage of her start of 2,000 years by standing still, going to sleep, and keeping herself to herself for centuries while the young Western nations were forging ahead, developing governments and education and inventions.", "The long sleep of the Chinese people and their hatred of new ideas", "There are many reasons that account for the long sleep. We will only speak of two that will help us to understand the history of this country, so unlike our own. One is that the Chinese have always greatly revered their parents and ancestors, going so far as to make it a first duty to carry on the work of life in exactly the same way that their forefathers had handed down.", "Another reason is that, with few exceptions, the Chinese have stayed at home within the limits of their own country. Then, as they also seldom encouraged foreigners to visit them—• indeed, they rigidly kept them out, as a rule—no new ideas of progress and reform, no new knowledge of outside discoveries and inventions, could penetrate the wall of reserve that shut in their heavenly, or celestial, kingdom, so superior, as they believed, to the rest of the earth. And, as time went on, they hated anything new or foreign more and' more. But that is changing now.", "Some say that ages ago the ancestors of the Chinese came from the Tarim basin and settled on the yellow loess- beds, where it was so easy to grow food. Anyway, here they lived, advancing in civilisation for long, long years, before they spread across the forest-covered mountain ranges which separate the basin of the Yellow River from that of the Yang-tse-kiang. Here, too, the tribes flourished and grew, and in time united under one ruler ; the government became more settled, and all sorts of arts developed, such as the rearing of silkworms and the weaving of silk. This has ever been one of China's greatest and most profitable industries.", "Confucius, the great teacher whose words are law to millions of men", "About twenty-six centuries ago a great teacher and leader arose, named Confucius, who, during his wandering and hard life, tried to find out how best a man could do his duty to his neighbour, and how best he could learn to govern himself. His teachings have been law to countless millions of his fellow-countrymen, his temples are found all over China, and his books have been the foundation of all learning through the centuries—for Confucius collected and set in order the history of the empire, and inspired a great many books in which his teaching is set forth.", "A few hundred years after his death, a prince of China reigned who ordered a great burning of the books of Confucius, and cruelly treated those who tried to keep them. One punishment was to send them to labour on a great wall that he was building, right across the north of China, to keep out the Mongolian horsemen, who were for ever descending on his country. Thirty feet high, fifteen feet wide at the top, faced with granite, with many towers of defence, this wonderful wall runs over hill and valley, across sand and river, up the face of the rocks, for 1,500 miles along the north border-line of China. This wall still divides China from Mongolia ; but it did not keep the Mongols out, any more than the Roman wall across Britain kept out the Piets and Scots.", "The great silent desert where China's Great Wall lies buried", "The last explorer to return from Central Asia is Dr. Stein, and the discoveries he made there are of importance and interest in connection with this great wall. For miles and miles, as far as the eye can see in the basin of the Tarim River, there stretches sand—not hing but dry, parched sand, that has fought and conquered mankind, overwhelming towns and villages, and sweeping away a flourishing civilisation. Of life there is practically no trace. Men have fled before those advancing grains of sand, that the}' were powerless to check; animals have died. Only one or two plants are able to exist in those desolate wastes. 11 is a land of sand—and silence, of which some pictures are found on page 4122 and the pages that follow.", "In these awful wastes, beneath the numerous sand-dunes, Dr. Stein made some interesting discoveries. He found that the Great Wall of China, which hitherto was thought to end at the foot of the Nan-Shan Mountains, does not end there at all. Far away to the west in the Tunghwan Desert he found the remains of a great wall, with watch-towers at intervals of two or three miles, that practically joins the wall at the foot of the Nan-Shan Mountains.", "This, he believes, is the true Great Wall of China, and the wall which we have always looked upon as the great wall is, apparently, much more modern.", "The history of a race that is buried under the sand of centuries", "There, from those silent and deserted houses and watch-towers, Dr. Stein has excavated that terrible sand, little by little, and his labour has been well repaid. Wooden slabs, with carefully wrought symbols and clay seals, private letters, official documents, frail materials of cotton and silk, and ancient paper, have all been recovered from the sand under which they have lain for many centuries, and these documents, when translated, may give us a history of the long-vanished race which once occupied the land that is now a great sandy waste, where life is insupportable.", "We can imagine with what fears these ancient people saw the sand creeping nearer and nearer ; how they battled with it valiantly, and tried to keep it from their homes; and how, at length, the sand slowly crept up to the houses and cottages, and into the rooms, driving the inhabitants forth, and gradually covering the entire place in a thick layer. But although the sand has destroyed, it has also preserved, and the relics which have been found will throw much light upon those ancient and deeply interesting times.", "More than a hundred years before the birth of Christ regular trade was opened up with Central Asia by China, and caravans began to wind along the routes from one oasis to another across the deserts, through the passes of Mongolia and Turkestan, to Tibet, carrying goods for trade by the infinite labour of men and dumb animals.", "The Golden Age of China when temples were built and books were printed", "Later, the empire suffered from many disturbances and divisions, and the struggles among several small rulers to be first and foremost. It was during these centuries, about the times when the Angles and Saxons were seeking their new homes across the North Sea, that the Buddhist religion took hold in China, though it had been introduced from India some centuries before. Temples were built all over the country, to house the thousands of images that were brought by the priests and monks.", "The three centuries after this are considered by the Chinese as one of the most glorious periods in their long history. Books and authors, schools and colleges, examinations and degrees, occupied a great place in public life. About the time when King Alfred was setting scholars laboriously to work with their pens and paint-brushes to copy manuscripts, Chinese records mention the printing of books by wooden blocks. About this time, too, an immense encyclopaedia was written. The fame of this learning and of the gorgeous palaces and riches of China was spread to Europe, chiefly by Arab traders, and ever since the romance and mystery of China has attracted the imagination and longing of the West.", "How the door was opened for Europe to get its first peep of China", "But it was not till the thirteenth century that the famous Marco Polo opened the door for Europe to get a passing view of the wonders of the dim and mysterious land of the Far East.", "Early in that century the Mongols had gradually been getting more and more power on the borders of Central Asia and in the north of China. When the great leader Jenghiz Khan, the 'Greatest of the Great', flashed over Western Asia and ruled over an empire stretching from the China Sea to Russia, some of the barriers that had hitherto prevented entry into China were swept away. The huge empire was divided I at his death among his sons, and a good  deal of intercourse followed between  China and Persia, Tibet and Mongolia.", "The Great Mongol Emperor who made Peking his capital", "It was the grandson of Jenghiz Khan, Kublai Khan, who welcomed Marco Polo so kindly to China, and sent him on so many missions to the wild provinces on the borders of Tibet and other distant parts of the empire. Deeply interesting is the account of Kublai's  reign by Marco Polo, as well as the writings of other travellers who seized the opportunity of exploring the heights of the Pamirs and the Tarim  basin; and some even crossed the Hwang-ho into China itself.", "Kublai added Southern China to his dominions, and made his new capital at Peking, the Court of the North. This great soldier proved equally great as a ruler; for he encouraged education and helped China in many ways.", "His grandson, Timur, or Tamerlane, was the last of these great Mongol rulers, He gave an order that Confucius should be held in great respect. After his death, rebellions and murders of emperors, great misgovernment, and other troubles brought the rule of the Mongols to an end. In the fifteenth century the Chinese drove them across the Great  Wall to the Altai Mountains, and  Mongolia became a province of the empire under the Chinese Ming family, or dynasty, of emperors, which lasted nearly 300 years. There were troubles at home and abroad during this time, difficulties with the Mongols and the Japanese, and, most important of all, the door which hid the Celestials from the Western 'barbarians' began to open just a little. The Portuguese and Spaniards appeared in China in the sixteenth century, and a Chinese fleet sailed as far as the Red Sea.", "A wonderful Chinese encyclopedia in thousands of volumes", "Very beautiful porcelain was made during the Ming dynasty, and another large encyclopaedia was brought out, which occupied many editors and assistants for several years. It is said that this is the largest encyclopaedia in the world. It runs to many thousands of volumes, and a copy of the first edition is now to be seen in the British Museum in the table cases in the King's Library. The Portuguese traders made but little impression on China, but the Jesuit missionaries managed to make their way inland in China to preach the Christian religion.", "There are many splendid remains of the great Ming dynasty in China, especially near Peking. Among them is a long avenue of large stone animals in various postures, leading to the wonderful tombs of the emperors. There are also many magnificent memorial archways.", "As the Ming dynasty was nearing its end, the Manchus, who were descendants of old Mongolian enemies of China, settled in Manchuria, about the River Amur, and made increasingly successful attacks on the empire till, in 1616, the Manchu line of rulers found themselves firmly seated on the throne, beyond the great wall that was built centuries before to keep out invaders. China is still ruled by emperors of the Manchu dynasty.", "The great struggle of the nations of Europe to set foot in China", "The last seventy years have seen a grim and never-ending game of the 'King of the Castle' going on between China and the Western Powers that are so anxious to gain footholds in her rich and ancient empire. The chief object for which these footholds were desired was to force the Christian religion and Western ideas upon a country which detested them, and to open up trade with people who had so much to sell, and whose great numbers mean great buying power.", "Little by little China has been forced to give way, and she has had to admit, one by one, her assailants into some part of the enchanted 'Castle'. Portu guese, Dutch, Germans, Russians and British for years carried on the struggle, and after wars and sieges and stormings, and endless discussion of a more peace- ful nature, the various foreign nations at last have gained the right of entry into the land so long closed to them. It was in 1842 that, by the Treaty of Nanking, certain treaty ports were opened to foreign trading ships, and, as time went on, more and more con- cessions had to be given to the foreigners; concessions and money were often exacted as a punishment for killing missionaries or other representatives and burning their property. Shortly after the settlement of Nan- king, a terrible rebellion devastated a large part of China for fifteen years. In 1864 the British were able to help the Government to restore order. In the centre of Trafalgar Square stands a statue of that fine soldier and man of action General Gordon, often spoken of as 'Chinese' Gordon, from the part he took in putting down this Taiping rebellion, as it was called.", "The first troubled years of China's awakening", "His campaign in the delta of the Yafig-tse-kiang, among the streams and canals and lakes, all broad and navigable channels, was most carefully planned, and was full of exciting events. In one action an armed steamer, with a crew of forty men, got the better of a force of many thousand rebels. He drilled the Chinese forces, urged on men less brave and energetic than himself, and showed the Chinese not only how to make war, but how to end it.", "These first years of China's awakening after the long, numbing sleep of centuries have, indeed, been full of trouble and pain. There have been almost incessant wars with the neighbours who could no longer be kept out, with Russia, France, Germany, Japan, and during these wars China has learnt by sad experience that her old ways of warfare, though picturesque in their setting, and almost sacred from long custom, were useless against those of her opponents. Now Chinese troops are drilled by Western methods.", "The Boxer rising and the flight of the emperor from Peking", "Naturally there has been much feeling against all the new ideas in this most conservative country in the world; the first railways were torn up as soon as laid; telegraphs were bitterly opposed, and Christian missionaries always carried their lives in their hands. So greatly have they been hated, in spite of the ability and devotion they have shown, especially in organising relief in times of dreadful famine and plague, that in 1900 a great rising—called the Boxer rising—took place, against the missionaries at first, but eventually all the hated foreigners were attacked. For two terrible months the European residents in China were in great danger.Many were killed, and others suffered all the terrors of a siege. They were shut up in Peking, with a howling mob eager for their lives outside, till relief came, and the Boxers were driven away. The allied forces made their way to Peking, and the emperor and his aunt fled far westward.", "The efforts of Christian missionaries in China have been sadly hampered by the actions of traders of their own faith, by their want of principle, and by the bad example that many of them have set. Great wrong has been done in the past by Englishmen in furnishing, for the sake of money, arms and help to the rebels who were devastating China when Gordon came to the rescue, and by their insisting on sending into China the poisonous drug opium, against the wishes of the rulers; this also for the sake of gain. The smoking of opium has quite as bad an effect on people as taking too much strong drink—it destroys them body and mind, and it has been a terrible curse to China. Strong efforts are now being made to persuade people to give up the habit that is so easy to form, and so very difficult to break.", "The sights of the city in which the Emperor of China lives.", "Foreigners have now gained more than a mere foothold on the shores of China. It is comparatively easy for them to pass from end to end of the beautiful and wonderful kingdom. Many travellers have already done so, and they have shown us, by words and photographs, the marvels of this long-shut-up land. Let us, too, pass in.", "There are three main ways of reaching China. We can go by the Siberian Railway, branching off through Manchuria, and crossing the Great Wall to Peking; or g we can travel to the East by going westwards that is, by steamer to North America, thence by train across the mighty continent to the Pacific, where steamers take us across to its other side or we can travel by steamer, through the Suez Canal, to any chosen port.", "All are most delightful and interesting journeys. Let us start at the 'Court of the North'. Peking contains at least a million inhabitants, and is near the Pei-ho River, at the mouth of which is its port, Tientsin. Peking is really made up of two cities the outside Chinese city, where business is done, and the inside, or Manchu-Tartar town, where the foreign embassies are.", "The emperor holds his great court in an enclosure full of splendid buildings in the centre of the Tartar city. To this famous Forbidden City very few foreigners ever gain admission.", "Grand, indeed, are the pageants to be seen when the emperor visits the Temple of Heaven to pray for a good harvest, leaving upon the mind a dazzling blur of golden yellow—the imperial colour of the Lord of the Yellow Land—of brilliant touches of blue, green, and crimson, as the trains of high officials in gorgeous array pass on in the procession. Long are the ceremonies, bowings, and prostrations, endless the prayers and readings from silken scrolls, as the incense floats towards heaven from bronze censers.", "In China men seem to go on being examined all their lives, chiefly in order to obtain appointments. There are examination centres all over the country, but it is- to Peking that thou- sands come every year to try to get into the highest college of all.", "In Peking are the imperial factories where the beautiful silks and china are made for the emperor to give as presents, and many splendid buildings, temples, tombs, palaces, and fairy-like gardens, stand out in striking contrast with the dirt and poverty everywhere to be seen. The dust—yellow dust—is dreadful in Peking, and penetrates into palace and hovel alike.", "There are railways now being rapidly developed in many directions, especially in the rich delta plain of China, con- necting the chief ports, and running far inland. Steamers, too, ply on the net- work of rivers and canals, besides the old-fashioned boats with square sails, called junks, so familiar in Chinese pictures. Where the shifting bed of the Hwang-ho has to be crossed, the bridges are some of the longest in the world.", "Shanghai is at the mouth of the Yang-tse River, and is one of the chief trade centres in the country. Here we find rows of European houses and shops, with their names hanging downwards, instead of across a signboard ; and the public gardens are full of most glorious flowers. Crowds of people, European and Chinese, rich and poor, throng the streets, and factories with smoky chimneys remind us of the new ways that have begun to replace the old.", "Nanking the Court of the South—is also a very important place on the Yang-tse River, and higher up still is Hankau, a great place for the tea trade. The porters waiting about for work on the tea steamers make us think of our dock labourers at home.", "From Hankau it is still some distance to the wonderful Yang-tse gorges, a thousand miles up the river from Shanghai. The high precipices, and towers of rocks and pinnacles, all of most fantastic or massive shapes, are relieved by the lovely trees and shrubs, and a profusion of flowers all growing wild : such as larkspur, jasmine, white lilies, sunflowers, and many others that we grow in gardens and hothouses in England. It is exciting work punting the boats on the rapids, and, before long, communication between the two ends of this difficult part of the river will be improved. The rich province of Szechuen—as large as France is watered by the upper Yang-tse River, and is full of mountain and water beauty, as well as great, rich crops of all kinds.", "The great Chinese port of Hong Kong that belongs to Britain", "There are many wonderful Buddhist temples and monasteries all over the country, often on mountains that are most difficult to climb. Pilgrims visit the shrines of saints, as in Tibet and India ; and prayer-wheels, and ringing of bells, and grand ceremonials, with reverence of the lamas, show how wide spread is the ancient religion.", "Hong Kong is an island, about the size of the Isle of Sheppey, at the mouth of the Sikiang, or West River, and it belongs to the British. It is now a most important place, both as a trading centre and as an Army and Navy station, though it was a bare rock little more than fifty years ago. Victoria, its capital, has a splendid harbour, and on its long quays, and in and out of its hive-like warehouses, thousands of Chinese work, dealing with the immense stacks of goods—silk and tea, cotton and woollen goods, coal, and many kinds of food—which all pass through this great port overlooked by hills.", "Canton the City of Perfection—is also on the West River, and for long it was the only port open to Europeans. Many Chinese live in boats on the river at Canton, and on other waterways.", "The cruel custom of crushing and pressing the feet of Chinese girls", "The very poor have a hard time in China, and among them baby girls are seldom welcomed, though every China- man is thankful and glad to have sons to carry on the customs connected with the worship of ancestors that alone can help them, as they believe, to happiness in a future life. It is one of the sights of China to see a family party setting off to the cemeteries on their great festival days, to honour, with gifts and feasting and1 enjoyment, the relations who have become 'guests on high.'", "Formerly, little girls had a sad time of it, though now matters are slowly improving for them. Married when very young to a husband she had perhaps never seen, the custom has long been that the little Chinese bride should go to live in her mother-in- law's house, and become a mere drudge. And this was not the worst of it.", "Centuries ago, before people wore stockings, linen bandages were wound round the legs and feet, somewhat after the manner of puttees. When the fashion arose of admiring small feet in China, the bandages were drawn even tighter. At last the toes were crushed out of shape right under the foot, which was pressed into a tiny shoe much too small for the foot of a healthy baby of a year old.", "We are filled with horror when we think of what the sad-eyed little Chinese girls go through to obtain little feet. Formerly, no Chinese girl could expect to be married unless she had small feet, and so, century after century, the cruel practice was carried on.", "A woman's custom that is changing and a man's custom that holds fast", "Happily, the custom is now dying out. Now there are anti-binding leagues, and many - Chinese have insisted on their daughters' feet being left free to develop with the rest of their bodies. It is not so with that other striking feature of China, however, the pigtail. Originally, the custom of wearing a pigtail was a badge of conquest by the Mongols, who insisted on Chinamen wearing their hair closely shaved in front with a long plait behind, so that they could be distinguished at a glance. But the Chinese have long looked upon it as a mark of honourable distinction, and grieve bitterly when anything happens to deprive them of what has been a life-long growth and care.", "To the wonders of China there are no end. The nation is awakening, and who can say what may be the future of a country with such a great seaboard on the important Pacific, and with enormous coal and iron beds scattered in its various provinces, and millions upon millions of thrifty workers?"]

          "paragraph": ["The immediate context of the excerpt below was British participation in the so-called Scramble of Africa during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These developments in Africa brought British colonial interests in direct contact with other expanding European powers in a resource-rich part of the world, often characterized by British writers at the time as a 'dark continent.' In 1884, at the Berlin Conference, leading European nations agreed to partition Africa into spheres of influence, from which direct-rule colonies could be carved by the beginning of the twentieth century. By 1914, British, French, German, Belgian, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish colonies had evolved into fixed colonies, with much of the African continent under either direct colonial rule or indirect influence of foreign empires.","Following the rapid expansion of the British Empire into the interior of Africa, cultural products, especially books and historical accounts recording imperial growth, emerged for domestic British audiences. The following excerpt comes from an article in The Children's Encyclopaedia which details colonial Africa outside of British administration. The text reviews histories of non-British colonization in central and western Africa, largely during the nineteenth century. It also provides general descriptions of foreign colonies, reviewing geography and topography, and discussing the arrival of peoples from the Middle East and Europe in the context of colonization. The encyclopedia article offers a historical interpretation that emphasizes the establishment of contact between European and Africa through the stories of explorers, especially those of British origination, such as Henry Stanley and David Livingstone. It also speaks of concurrent Arabic exploration in northeast Africa, though in different terms, with the role of the slave trade emphasized in association with the growth Arab influence. The article then examines the development of greater knowledge and exploration of the continent in the second half of the nineteenth century, using stories of select cities and of colonies as case studies for broader themes. In these accounts, references to foreign colonies and or protectorates often follow through the lens of the British government's perception of other colonizing powers, a frequent and recurring feature of period British writings on the subject of empire.", "In the accounts of German and French African colonies, a vaguely positive perception is emphasized with occasional lamentations on the continued work in countering such scourges as the slave trade and economic development, contemporary justifications for imperialism. These positions reflected government policy seeking both cooperation with the German Empire and France, and an underlying, though not publicly stated unease in an era of frequent expansionism and war. This moderation contrasted with the narrative of incompetence characterized by the excerpt's account of Ottoman imperial possessions in Africa. For instance, the Ottomans are blamed for Egypt's 'lost' prosperity. The Ottoman Empire, perceived as declining and hostile to British interests and the interests of closer allies, was also contrasted negatively with the 'great prosperity' brought to colonial subject under British control. The use of general stereotypes throughout the article, such as the reference to Africans as 'savages' and focus on African inability to resist the vestiges of European-style industrial progress are also themes common to period colonialist literature. Nowhere in this encyclopedia article is the real complexity, or political maneuvering of local African rulers and administrators, including in British spheres, outlined."

            "Egypt, Abyssinia, Morocco, Liberia, the Sahara, and the Possessions of the European Nations","The burning sun, traveling overhead some part of the year in the greater part of Africa, looks down on millions of black and brown men—negroes and others—on millions of Arabs, on an ever-increasing number of white men from Europe, and on nearly all the beautiful and interesting animals with which we stock our Zoological Gardens. It is one of these animals, the elephant, with his valuable ivory tusks, that has helped to make history in Africa. Now, the animals and the various tribes of negroes and other races, which are still in many cases heathen and uncivilised, have been there for an unknown length of time, roaming the splendid forests and living by the wonderful rivers and lakes, for ever absorbed in finding food and avoiding enemies. The valuable rubber trees in these forests have also helped in a very great measure to make history in Africa. The Arabs, from the other side of the Red Sea, came at various times through the centuries, and found their way down the coasts, over desert and plain, over rivers and mountains, all over the land. Their coming brought woe to the black men. The white men did not begin to come, except to the coasts within hail of Europe, till nearly the time of Columbus: and their coming also brought woe to the black men. The sorrow of Africa can be summed up in three words—slaves, ivory, rubber. In the oldest maps, made by those who lived on the Mediterranean nearly 2,000 years ago, all that is shown of Africa is the north and north-western shores, and the narrow land of Egypt in the north-east corner near the Isthmus of Suez. This neck of land, joining Africa to Asia, was, in the past, the great highway of the nations from east to west… But neither the civilised old Egyptians nor the peoples of the northern shores knew much of the great continent behind the strip on which they lived, for the great desert stood as a barrier in the way, and the ship of the desert, the long-enduring camel, was not launched on the ocean of sand till the much later times of the Romans.","HOW BRAVE MARINERS WHO FIRST DREW THE MAP OF AFRICA","We have to pass over many centuries, to the days of Prince Henry the Navigator and his brave Portuguese, of whom we read on page 3356, before much change is seen on the map of Africa. One of the results of their daring efforts, of their courage and perseverance, was that the discovery and shape of the outer rim of the great continent was made known to the world, and Africa, as a whole, could be sketched on the maps, together with the names of the settlements made gradually along the coasts by the Arab traders and the seafaring nations of Europe. But the interior of the great Dark Continent—what of that? The Arabs had always tracked farther and farther inland in pursuit of their dreadful trade—kidnapping and selling human beings; and in time the white men followed their horrid example.","HOW EGYPT BECAME A TURKISH PROVINCE AND LOST MUCH OP ITS WEALTH","So Egypt passed to another stage in its long history, and became a province of Turkey, but it remained practically under the rule of the Mamelukes, with a ruler, or pasha, sent from Constantinople. The province, like many others, was taxed to the uttermost, and became poorer not only from that cause, but also because much of its trade passed from Alexandria to Constantinople. It also lost, about this time, the large sums it had levied on all goods passing to and from India over the Isthmus of Suez, when Vasco da Gama found the sea-route to the East round the Cape of Good Hope. More than 200 years passed by, during which the Mameluke beys, or governors, under a nominal Turkish chief, fought and struggled with each other, entertained lavishly, built and restored fine mosques, and encouraged Mohammedan learning and the arts, when suddenly, and most unexpectedly, the wave of upheaval set in motion in France by the Revolution reached the extreme end of the Mediterranean. Napoleon, longing to overthrow British power in India, determined to master the East by attacking Egypt. He managed to get his fleet from Toulon to Alexandria, and to fight the famous battle of the Pyramids, before Nelson could come to the rescue. We know how the brilliant successes of General Kleber, after Napoleon had returned to Europe, dwindled into complete failure, and how in the end 24,000 French troops were taken back to France in English vessels. The English themselves left Egypt soon after."

One of the results of their daring efforts, of their courage and perseverance, was that the discovery and shape of the outer rim of the great continent was made known to the world, and Africa, as a whole, could be sketched on the maps, together with the names of the settlements made gradually along the coasts by the Arab traders and the seafaring nations of Europe. But the interior of the great Dark Continent—what of that? The Arabs had always tracked farther and farther inland in pursuit of their dreadful trade—kidnapping and selling human beings ; and in time the white men followed their horrid example, as we read on page 2024. But for a long time little or nothing was known in Europe about the vast heart of Africa, and so the map-makers were driven to fill up the blank white space with drawings of fancy animals. Indeed, those of us who were at school only half a century ago found Africa a very easy map to draw and learn—there were so few names in the middle of it.","THE JOY OF THE MEN WHO DISCOVERED THE SECRETS OF DARKEST AFRICA","On page 141 we read how strong, brave, and good men have followed each other, exploring the unknown parts of Africa, some with the view of helping to destroy the slave trade and to teach the negroes, others to find out the sources of the rivers and to map out the country'. Intense was their joy when the great lakes burst upon their astonished sight, and the snowy peaks came into view, and the thundering roar of mighty waterfalls on stupendous rivers deafened their ears as the boiling foam dashed high in the air. These were some of the secrets hidden so long in the heart of Africa. Of all the sorrowful ones that explorers have found, the saddest are the hard, beaten-down paths across Africa, trodden for centuries by the feet of gangs of miserable slaves, torn from their homes, which were often lake dwellings for safety. Sometimes they would carry ivory to the coast; but for none of them was there any return. We can follow the light-bearers into the Dark Continent by reading their most interesting narratives, and by studying in the Ethnographical Gallery of the British Museum the specimens of the work of the numerous tribes they visited: these objects show their curious customs and manners and taste. Many of the travellers are held in remembrance by the names of places on the map; and, standing by Livingstone's last resting-place in the nave of Westminster Abbey, or by' Speke's monument in Kensington  Gardens, we think of the chain of graves that mark the white man's progress across unknown Africa. Much of it, owing to the great heat and the swamps, and the insects that carry infection, is very unhealthy and trying, especially to Europeans.","HOW THE SLAVE TRADE IS DISAPPEARING AS AFRICA GETS BETTER KNOWN","But the map is still filling up; the slave trade is gradually being suppressed; and serious attention is being called to the cruelties practised on the natives forced to collect rubber. Let us now turn to the relief map on page 4253, and look more closely at the great continent, with the countries of the widely differing people that live upon it. It is not all new to us, for we know its shape by reading about the British Empire in Africa in that part of our book beginning on page 1765. Its southern tip points to the South Pole; its eastern horn points to India, and round the Gulf of Guinea it faces westwards. We read, too, in the stories of France and Germany, of their vast possessions in Africa, and may, perhaps, realise the great heat of the Red Sea as the pilgrims cross it on their way to Mecca, or the steamers pass by the short cut to India. As we look at the narrowness of the Strait of Gibraltar, we think again of the Moorish warriors pouring over the sea into Spain. We are probably familiar with the eastern end of the wide, far-reaching deserts of the middle of the Old World, for we read about it in the story of Arabia, Syria, and Persia, on page 3874. Its western extension, separated from the eastern side only by the narrow Red Sea and the equally narrow fertile valley of there are oases, such as we see in Asia, where springs of precious water, with refreshing vegetation, make life possible. The hills that rise from the sun-scorched Sahara are higher than any in Great Britain. South of the Abyssinian heights rise the twin giants of Africa—Kilimanjaro and Kenia-both close to the Equator, and between the great lake, Victoria Nyanza, which is as large as Scotland, and the sea. Both are taller than Mont Blanc by some thousands of feet. The land in this mountainous region sinks to the sea in particularly steep terraces. The hilly borders of the high inland tablelands sometimes come close down to the sea; sometimes there is a varying width of coastal plain, generally very unhealthy for Europeans. Both act as guards that defend the country. And the rivers of Africa, leaping and foaming down the terraces and gorges of hills that edge the plateaus, are not open gates for trade and conquest like the Yang-tse-kiang, the Rhine, and the St. Lawrence, for in most cases through navigation, from the sea inland, is impossible. Still, when the difficulties of the rapids are overcome, explorers find the immense reaches of the navigable parts of the rivers the easiest way by which to open up the country.","THE NILE, THAT FLOWS IN EGYPT LIKE A MIGHTY THOUGHT THREADING A DREAM","There is at least one immense river to every side of Africa. On the north, draining to the Mediterranean for over 3,000 miles, is the Nile, one of the most interesting and wonderful rivers in the world, 'flowing through Egypt like some grave, mighty thought threading a dream.' The first cataract, or rapid, on the Nile is hundreds of miles from the sea. Into the Indian Ocean on the east side pours the great Zambesi River, opposite the island of Madagascar. Navigation is very difficult near its mouth. Its tributary, the Shire, drains Lake Nyassa, and is of great use in passing through the country. The magnificent Victoria Falls, high up on the Zambesi itself, can only be compared with Niagara. The great river suddenly dashes over a cliff about 330 feet high, with a deafening roar, while the spray is shot high in the air. Truly it is one of the wonders of the world! From the high tableland beyond the group of great lakes rises the mighty Congo, nearly 3,000 miles long; it circles away to the western side of the continent to empty its immense volume of gathered waters into the Atlantic. The explorer Stanley marched for five months through unbroken forests in its basin, and his name is commemorated in the Stanley Falls. There are over 6,000 miles of navigable waterway in the Congo and its tributaries that are above the deep gorge through which it reaches the sea by many falls. The three great rivers of the future.","THAT WATER THE HEART OF AFRICA","The Niger, with its tributary, the Benue, draining into the Gulf of Guinea, is also very important in opening up a way to some of the richest land in Africa. It touches the Sahara on the south, near Timbuktu, the central meeting place of the caravan traffic. The Zambesi, Congo, and Niger may be called rivers of the future, so vast are the resources to be opened up in their basins. The Nile has a great past as well as great prospects. For countless centuries it was worshipped as a god, so mysterious and wonderful are the blessings it brings to the country it has made. The mystery has disappeared since the sources of the Nile were discovered; and no longer are beautiful thanksgiving hymns sung to the Nile, nor offerings cast into its placid bosom ; but it steadily goes on making and blessing Egypt. 'Egypt is the gift of the Nile.' Now, Egypt is practically a long, narrow oasis in the great mid-world desert. In shape it has been compared to a lily with a bent stalk. The lily is the delta on the Mediterranean, and the stalk is the long course of the river, with the few miles of green and fertile land that lies upon either side.","HOW THE NILE COVERS EGYPT EVERY YEAR WITH A MANTLE OF FERTILE MUD","We might ask how the fertile soil, under which lies the desert sand and rock, got there. Every year through the centuries, except in black years of famine, the Nile at certain seasons has swollen and risen from its bed, flooding the lower country till it all looks like a sea of many islands, with the villages and farms standing out above the expanse of water. A mantle of delicate green is thrown over all a few months later, when the water has subsided and has left behind the layer of mud which makes Egypt so fertile. Three crops a The city of Algiers is nearly a thousand years old, and is a wonderful meeting-place of Eastern and Western life. For centuries it was misgoverned by its Turkish deys, or rulers, but in 1830 the French took Algiers and have made it a fine city. Its great glory is a wide avenue with a magnificent terrace built by an Englishman. These crops a year grow in the fields, enriched and refreshed by the waters of the Nile. It is impossible to sail or steam along the broad river-highway without being filled with wonder at the stupendous remains and ruins on its banks. They are the glory of Egypt, the works of the men who chanted hymns to the Nile-god thousands of years ago. We can enjoy the grand buildings and enter into the old life of the country in another part of this book, so let us now take up the story of Egypt when tire Egyptians were under the Romans. When Britain was but an outlying, barbarous province of the great empire, Egypt, in its south-east corner of the Mediterranean, easy of access to almost every part of the Roman world, was one of the most civilised and important of its provinces. We have seen how distant Britain had to be abandoned when the empire grew weaker in the fifth century. Egypt remained under the Eastern, or Greek, Empire after the great division into East and West, and had its share of attacks and misfortunes a with the rest of that long-dying Power.","HOW THE PERSIANS CONQUERED EGYPT, BUT WERE DRIVEN OUT","The Persians, early in the seventh I century, held Egypt for ten years, but were forced by Heraclius to retire. We read of this gallant emperor on page 3152. In these centuries there were great difficulties about religion. When the Egyptians accepted the Christian faith with the rest of the empire, they tacked on all sorts of ideas and customs connected with their ancient faith. There were endless persecutions and difficulties between those who thought one thing and those who thought another, and the feeling became very bitter among these different sects: When the Mohammedan troops of the Caliph Omar, about whom we read a in the story of South-west Asia, on page 3876, appeared before Alexandria, the great seaport of Egypt, there was no united front in Egypt against these followers of Islam, and they were able to carry everything before them. And so Egypt passed under the sway of the caliphs and the Arab tribes, many of whom had long before made settlements round the east coast, and spread not only over Egypt and North Africa, but ever farther and farther inland. On the whole, the Egyptian Christians, or Copts, had a better time under the rule of the caliphs than they had had under the Greek Christian emperors: but the country was neither developed nor well governed in those luxurious days, and it was often divided by quarrels about religion. After a time began the struggles with the conquering Turks. The wise saladin, who did much for","THE WISE SALADIN, WHO DID MUCH FOR EGYPT AND ENCOURAGED LEARNING","The great Saladin, at the end of the twelfth century, did much for Egypt with his wise government. He fortified Cairo, the capital, situated on the banks of the Nile, about 100 miles from the sea, and strengthened the country against invasion, put down rebellions, seized ports on the Red Sea, and sent expeditions in various directions. Saladin's brother and nephew carried on his efforts. The methods of storing the Nile's overflow and carrying it where needed were improved, and trade and learning were encouraged. It was in these days that a famous cavalry corps called the Mamelukes was founded, developed from bodyguards and brigades of strong young Turkish slaves. They gradually rose in power till the strongest and cleverest of these troops were able to make themselves in turn sultans and masters of Egypt. The story of their power, which lasted nearly 300 years, reads like a romance. At first slaves, then trained soldiers, they became chiefs and sultans. The rise and the fall of individuals among the Mamelukes was rapid; power was only maintained by the strength and length of the sword. Such wild feats of horsemanship at polo matches and archery; such dazzling processions; such luxury in costly palaces adorned with ivory, gold, and silver; such rich carpets and hangings and sumptuous feasts almost baffle description.","THE SPLENDID MOSQUES THAT MAMELUKE RULERS BUILT FOR EGYPT","The Mameluke rulers were great builders, as many of the splendid mosques, especially that of the Sultan Hassan, and other buildings in Cairo, still testify. When the Ottoman sultans found their way to Constantinople, it was not long before they determined to conquer Egypt. In vain An old Arab writer has said that 'he who hath not seen Cairo hath not seen the world ; its soil is gold; its Nile is a wonder; its houses are palaces; and its air is soft, its odour surpassing that of aloes-wood, and cheering the heart.' Perhaps none of its people has done so much to beautify the native city as the craftsman who works in ivory and wood, and produces the beautiful lattice-work that is so famous. He uses his left foot as a third hand, and, because of his skill in the use of this foot, he is known in the city as the 'three-handed man.' The photographs on these pages are by Messrs. Underwood & Underwood and Messrs. Valentine.","THE DAILY LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF CAIRO","Cairo has a large European population, but the picturesque part of the city is the native quarter. This is truly Oriental, and the wonderful lattice-work of the houses shows Saracen art at its best. The streets are thronged, and the fruit merchants do a good business. The streets of Cairo are narrow and winding, and the buildings present an endless variety of style. A traveller in the native quarter might think himself in some fairyland of the 'Arabian Nights.' A familiar sight is the lemonade-seller vending his cordial were extra taxes levied in the doomed country, fortifications erected, and the army strengthened. The fatal battle was fought near Cairo in 1517; street by street the capital was stormed, and the massacre of its people was carried on day after day for a whole week.","HOW EGYPT BECAME A TURKISH PROVINCE AND LOST MUCH OP ITS WEALTH","So Egypt passed to another stage in its long history, and became a province of Turkey, but it remained practically under the rule of the Mamelukes, with a ruler, or pasha, sent from Constantinople. The province, like many others, was taxed to the uttermost, and became poorer not only from that cause, but also because much of its trade passed from Alexandria to Constantinople. It also lost, about this time, the large sums it had levied on all goods passing to and from India over the Isthmus of Suez, when Vasco da Gama found the sea-route to the East round the Cape of Good Hope. More than 200 years passed by, during which the Mameluke beys, or governors, under a nominal Turkish chief, fought and struggled with each other, entertained lavishly, built and restored fine mosques, and encouraged Mohammedan learning and the arts, when suddenly, and most unexpectedly, the wave of upheaval set in motion in France by the Revolution reached the extreme end of the Mediterranean. Napoleon, longing to overthrow British power in India, determined to master the East by attacking Egypt. He managed to get his fleet from Toulon to Alexandria, and to fight the famous battle of the Pyramids, before Nelson could come to the rescue. We know how the brilliant successes of General Kleber, after Napoleon had returned to Europe, dwindled into complete failure, and how in the end 24,000 French troops were taken back to France in English vessels. The English themselves left Egypt soon after.","THE Cruel MOHAMMED ALI, WHO PUT AN END TO THE MAMELUKE RULE","After this a dreadful tyrant, named Mohammed Ali. arose in Egypt. An Albanian by birth, he made his way upwards by great ability, and became pasha. He pushed his conquests to Arabia and to the Sudan, seized all the landed estates in Egypt itself, and extorted money and service from the miserable peasants, or jellahin, some of whom are descendants of the old Egyptians. At last he managed to get 500 of the 1 Mameluke beys into the citadel of Cairo, and massacred them all. We perhaps know the miserable part he and his son played when the Greeks were striving for independence, and of how Mohammed Ali finally made a brilliant success against the Sultan of Turkey, till then nominally his master. But the result of his successes were speedily lost by the rebellion of the conquered against his cruelties and oppression. The chief event of the reign of Said Pasha, who was Mohammed Ali's youngest son, was the granting permission to the French engineer, De Lesseps, to make the Suez Canal. This stupendous work, nearly 100 miles long, was carried out in thirteen years, making Africa an island instead of a peninsula; and the world's ships now steam through the canal on their way north and south, carrying much of the goods traffic and nearly all the passengers to the Far East.","THE OPEACE AND PROSPERITY BROUGHT TO EGYPT BY GREAT BRITAIN","Egypt's trade had a period of prosperity in supplying cotton, which grows so well there, when the American Civil War ruined the valuable fields on the Mississippi; but the country's money affairs were so mismanaged that they gained little benefit. England, which was the sea Power most concerned in keeping the way open to India, managed to plant a very firm foot in Egypt. It is England which has helped to arrange the affairs of the Khedive, as the Egyptian ruler, subject in name to Turkey, is now called; and it is chiefly Englishmen who have developed the country and put it in order. The events of late years have been full of interest and trouble. Mutiny and jealousy in the Army was put down after the battle of Tel-el-Kebir and the fall of Alexandria. Many of our soldiers to-day are wearing the clasp of this battle, which took place in 1882. Therehave been endless difficulties in the part of the Sudan which lies in the basin of the Nile. Sudan means the land of the blacks. It stretches right across Africa south of the Sahara—a fertile, well watered, and very hot belt of country, now divided among various Powers. For many years the Sudan, as far as the great lakes Egyptian governors, whose chief idea was to get money out of the people, whom they sorely oppressed, especially in the terrible trade of slave-raiding. Genera] Gordon, whose pluck and energy in the suppression of the Taiping rebellion in China is known to the whole world, was appointed governor, and did good work for some years.","HOW GENERAL GORDON WAITED FOR THE HELP THAT CAME TOO LATE","The Egyptian forces met with some terrible defeats while trying to grapple with the rebellion organised by the Mahdi—a Mohammedan prophet who led the people, risen against the tax-gatherers and slave-drivers who had devastated their country. At last Gordon was sent out again to see what could be done. He was soon surrounded by the forces of the Mahdi at Khartoum, and nothing could exceed the courage and heroism of his defence, always waiting in hope for the relief from without which came too late. It is a grand and pathetic picture to bear in mind, of the white man standing unmoved, unarmed, in the presence of the yelling black mob rushing at him with their long spears. For eleven years the Sudan was left, cut off from the world, in an awful state of desolation, in which the people were starving and dying ; and then General Kitchener, with a carefully trained army, took Khartoum and gained a brilliant victory at Omdurman. Since then railways from Egypt have penetrated to Khartoum, and connected it with the Red Sea. And in memory of the hero who lost his life, Gordon College has been built, to help on the education of the people in this great district. It is hoped that some day the Sudan will be as valuable as Egypt itself, if irrigated and planted with cotton and corn; but the possession of the country of the upper waters of the Nile is necessary to Egypt, so dependent is it on its great river to water the soil.","THE TORRENTS OF RAIN THAT CARRY THE MUD OF ABYSSINIA INTO EGYPT","When the tributaries of the Blue Nile and Atbara were traced to the highlands of Abyssinia, the mystery of the rise of the Nile and its fertilising mud were solved. The torrents of tropical rain tear down the earth from the gorges and the cliffs, and the muddy water rushes down through Nubia over the chain of cataracts to the almost level course from Assuan to the sea. It is at Assuan that the great dam across the river has been made to regulate the supply of water. It means famine and bitter sorrow to the people of Egypt when the Nile rises too little or too much, for then the fine crops of cotton, corn, flax, sugar, and hemp fail, and there is famine in the land. Abyssinia is an independent state that has had many passages at arms with European nations. The hardy mountaineers adopted Christianity in early times; they have now many curious customs and beliefs. At Khartoum the Blue Nile joins the White Nile, the main stream from the British district of Uganda, where it drains the Victoria and Albert Nyanza —the word Nyanza means lake. Few countries can give more exciting adventures than Uganda and the district between it and the sea. The railway now connects it with Egypt and with Mombasa, the gate of British East Africa.","A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE SEE LIONS AND GIRAFFES FROM THE TRAINS","Travellers speak of seeing lions, giraffes, and zebras from the carriage windows. Some of us would dread to get out at the stations! But sportsmen go out to shoot the big game, and enjoy hunting the huge hippopotamus and rhinoceros on the riverbanks. We read in the story of Spain, beginning on page 3353, how the Mohammedans swept along the northern states of Africa—often called the Barbary States, from the early inhabitants, the Berbers—on their way to turn the European Pillar of Hercules into the Rock of Tarik, or Gibraltar. For some hundreds of years they remained in undisputed possession of the coast, and then Spain began to carry its arms across the sea against the hated Moslems. In the sixteenth century pirates established themselves in the harbours of the coast; and Charles V made many efforts, only partly successful, to dislodge them. These pirates, or corsairs, were men of extraordinary daring, and by attacking merchant ships and wealthy town's they secured great riches for their booty. When their stronghold was at last taken, a whole roomful of money was found containing heaps of coins of all countries, showing by their dates how widespread were the attacks of these fierce sea-robbers. Many and grievous are the stories of the sufferings of their prisoners. They made slaves of them if large ransoms were not paid. Eventually the Turks were drawn into the almost endless contest, and succeeded in obtaining for a while the chief power in North Africa. Many European states paid large sums to buy freedom from the attacks of the corsairs, who carried on their evil ways till less than one hundred years ago basin of the Niger, and along the western coast of the great continent. Morocco, the most westerly of the Barbary States, is independent, like Abyssinia; and in it live Moors, descendants of the Mohammedans who conquered it in the seventh century, the Berbers, and numbers of Jews and negroes. Affairs have long been unsettled in Morocco, and all Europe seems to be standing round offering to help set things straight. France tries to reform the Government and money affairs, with the consent of Great Britain. The United States refused to do this, and sent fleets against them; and, at last, with the help of the English, who stood too long aloof, and the Dutch, matters improved; but it was not till 1830 that the French finally took Algiers and destroyed tor ever the nests of the pirates. They set the captives free, took the roomful of money, and founded, after many difficulties, the French empire in Africa, which, as we read on page 2399, is so flourishing, spreading, as it does, over the Central and Western Sudan, over the and Spain. France and Spain are organising a large police force, and there is a Swiss Inspector-General. Turkey in Africa, once such a large district, is now reduced to the state of Tripoli, as Tunis is under French protection, and the Khedive of Egypt is practically independent of the Sultan. If we look at the map or, page 4253, or make a map of Africa, marking the chief divisions, and set in each division little flags of the countries who own them, we shall gain a good idea of what is meant by 'the scramble for Africa'. Except in a few cases, as we have seen, the uncivilised black races and tribes have been unable to hold their country either against Arabs or white men. So when particulars began to be known about the vast interior, at a time when most European nations were desiring room to expand across the seas, they turned to 'unoccupied' Africa, each seizing the parts that were most easy to annex. The flags make a gay fringe right round the coast of the great continent.","THE FLAGS OF THE NATIONS THAT FLY ALL ROUND THE AFRICAN COASTS","Let us start from Egypt, with its crescents and stars. Tripoli comes next, with the Turkish flag; Tunis and Algeria must be pegged out with French flags, stretching far south beyond the mountains into the Sahara. Some day the French hope to push a railway across the desert to their possessions on the Niger. Independent Morocco has its own red flag, though that of Spain signals from Ceuta, the Southern Pillar of Hercules, to the Union Jack that flies on the rock of Gibraltar. Spain also owns the Sahara coast from Morocco to Cape Blanco, where the enormous French West African possessions begin. The independent striped flag of Liberia, the state of freed slaves, waves on the coast of Guinea, surrounded by numbers of Portuguese, British, French, and German flags, all marking the various divisions now owned by their countries. Then, on the Congo, we have French flags again marking out the territory reaching up to Lake Chad, that curious lake, sometimes as large as Wales and sometimes a mere swamp.","THE CONGO STATE, THAT IS NOW UNDER THE RULE OF BELGIUM","The Congo State, now under the rule of the Belgians, has only enough room on the coast to plant its flag, though it expands large and square in the interior to Uganda and German East Africa. Angola is Portuguese, so is a long strip watered by the Zambesi on the east coast, opposite Madagascar, which from end to end is French. South of Angola comes the German flag again. The southern tip of the continent needs many British flags to mark out its involved boundaries far up into Rhodesia. Between Rhodesia and British East Africa is the large tract of German East Africa, with the three beautiful lakes of Nyassa, Tanganyika, and Victoria Nyanza on its borders. On these great lakes are busy steamers connecting with the growing railway lines. From Zanzibar, celebrated for its cloves, the caravans for the interior fit out; and many are the stirring adventures with slave-ships on this part of the coast. Italian flags wave on the horn of Africa, reaching up to the Gulf of Aden, where British Somaliland separates Italian Somaliland from the other Italian colony, which cuts off Abyssinia from the Red Sea. Rhodesia is named after that farseeing statesman, Cecil Rhodes, and one of his many great plans for Africa was to unite north and south by a railway from the Cape to Cairo, his object being to cut Africa through the centre and pick up trade along the route. He longed to see the spray of the Victoria Falls from railway carriages crossing the Zambesi, and to hear the whistle of the engine along the Congo-Zambesi watershed to Lake Tanganyika, and the steady breathing of the iron horse racing the Nile stream to Khartoum to join the line from the north.","THE DREAM OF A GREAT ENGLISHMAN THAT IS COMING TRUE","Besides this main trunk-line, his mind planned many junctions to link up other railways or waterways from the great central plateaus to ports on the east and west. Some of his great dream has come true. The railway from the south has crossed the falls, and plans are on foot to join the Congo basin with the Rhodesian railways and the traffic on the great lakes. Enterprise like this strikes at the very root of the slave trade and the cruelties connected with the gathering of ivory and rubber; for rapid travel opens up dark places and draws together the great and varied interests of the huge continent. And it is this lighting up and linking up that alone will make it possible for Europeans to carry out the obligations they take upon themselves when they hoist their flags over vast numbers of uncivilised natives in Africa. The trade of this vast country on either side of the railway is in its infancy, but great prospects are foreshadowed."]

          "paragraph": ["Expanding across the globe from the sixteenth to the late twentieth century, England, and later Great Britain, established colonies in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. British Imperialism in its early years was frequently based on economic power. By the late nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth century, Great Britain shifted towards a new type of imperialism based on racial and cultural superiority. Specifically, they deemed themselves as higher in rank and status than the rest of the world based on racial ideas and British culture. In the 1900s, British writers, journalists, and artists expressed through books, encyclopaedias, and photographs, these ideas of superiority compared with non-European indigenous peoples. This had the effect of denying indigenous peoples' existence and cultural autonomy.","The following excerpt comes from a travelogue published in Arthur Mee's The New Children's Encyclopaedia in London in 1911. It elaborates on the pride and power of the British Empire. When you read this article today, you can immediately sense the superiority that the British Empire projected onto the rest of the world. The author of this article boasts about Great Britain's pride in what they describe as a better way of life versus indigenous cultures worldwide. The writer also incorporates words for indigenous peoples such as 'redskins' and 'savages' in ways that would be unacceptable and offensive today. The article even provides pictures of Native Americans in North America with subheadings about how they were subjected to British rule, which take a mocking tone towards them.","This travelogue reflects the racism and exploitation of power that was common in colonialist literature of the early 1900s. Great Britain was already more privileged in terms of wealth and economic status compared to indigenous peoples on other continents. The British Empire, from this point of view, benefitted from taking advantage of their power in ways that would allow them to marginalize indigenous peoples on a global scale."

            "THE GREAT ISLAND CONTINENT PASSES BY","Then, though we would fain linger among the Maoris, hearing about the way they are taking to education, examining the wonderful carvings on their houses, looking at the extraordinary tattooings on the old chiefs, the world will not stand still for us, and we seem to hear, on the wind, the triumphant words, Advance Australia. The great island-continent, twenty-five times larger than the United Kingdom, takes three hours to pass by; and here, as in New Zealand and Canada, we see chiefly the descendants of countrymen who have travelled far to found new homes. There are now left only a few of the blacks, the old natives who had the whole land to themselves before the Europeans came with their new animals and plants and the new ways of life, and these surviving natives are as uncivilised as any people on the globe.","Many act as helpers on the huge sheep-farms fringing the great waterless desert in the heart of Australia, the oldest land in the world. Many of the poor blacks look as if they had scarcely sense to understand our good wishes, but their eyes sparkle at the present of a few bright beads. For the next hour the familiar flag holds its own on parts of the great mass of islands north and north-west of Australia, and we are kept busy making acquaintance with all sorts of differing types of people in Borneo, in New Guinea, in the long peninsula of Malay, and Ceylon. Then comes India, that immense peninsula pointing southward, twelve times larger than the United Kingdom, with seven times as many people in it. The greater part of this vast country, made up of many different states, peopled with men of different races, manners, customs, is now under the rule of the small and distant Great Britain.","THE HOUSES BUILT OF SNOW</","The natives of the country are few and far between. Along the northern and eastern coasts, and round Hudson Bay, we find some wandering tribes of Indians and Eskimos—that very ancient people. How shuddering cold it all looks! We can hardly realise the poverty of the lives of the people here, in those pudding-basin-shaped houses, built of blocks of frozen snow, in winter, and in tents in summer. Some of them, we know, read the book we hold in our hands. A happy new year to them will mean success in hunting and fishing, for they depend on walrus, bear, seal, and fish, with no vegetables, or fruit, or bread. We wish them good fortune with their useful dogs, and good health for the fat little brown baby so snugly tucked away in the hood of over the continent before the palefaces came from beyond the sea. Fiercely and bitterly the redskins fought for their own, when French and English tried to make settlements. The country bordering the great rivers and lakes, the boundless woods and prairies, have all been the scenes of the most thrilling adventures. Who has not—in story - books and dreams — hunted breathlessly with the fur-traders; held forts at fearful odds, with brave comrades, against the Indians; fled noiselessly, scarcely daring to breathe, through deep forests, over frozen rivers, to warn lonely stations of the coming enemy? Can we ever forget the leaping terror of the war-whoops, the war-trails, the war dances of the wild savages in paint and feathers? And how we loved the friendly ones! It is all changed now."

          "paragraph": ["TRAVEL OUR FELLOW-CITIZENS", "Those of us born under the British flag belong to the most wonderful company of fellow-citizens that has ever been known. The Union Jack waves over the homes of 400 million people. In these pages the writer imagines that we are watching the world go round, and if we could see the peoples of the world like this, one in every four would belong to our own empire. There is hardly a language on the earth which is not spoken in our empire. Our people are of every race and faith and colour, and in every stage of civilisation. Our flag flies in the frozen North and in the blazing tropics, in the lands of the elephant and the tiger, in places where palms grow in the street and where nothing grows at all. Let us imagine that this mighty empire is marching past.", "AN EMPIRE MARCHES PAST THE WONDERFUL PROCESSION OF PEOPLE UNDER THE BRITISH FLAG", "Will you come with us to wish a friendly Happy New Year to those of our fellows who live right round the world under the beloved Union Jack? We want to see them, as far as we can. How is it to be done? We might put a girdle round the earth, like Ariel, and salute all who come within sight of our arrowy path. But we must try for a broader, wider view than that, and not quite so rapid, if we are to see and recognise the peoples of an empire upon which the sun never sets. So, instead of fancying ourselves passing round the world, from con- tinent to island, seeking out our fellow-citizens, let us imagine that we are poised steadily in space above it, watching it turn round once on its axis, before the great life-giving sun. All through the long day of twenty-four shining hours we will watch together the earth-ball turning, and ever, as one part of the empire rolls out of sight, another part will come into the light. What a grand march past it will be, of all sorts of people, at home in their widely differing, widely parted countries! At dawn on New Year's Day we shoot like rockets up into the blue. There is no time for talk about eyes not being far-seeing enough, or the difficulties of standing upon nothing, or the anxiety of what we shall have to breathe or eat during the march past, or even the likelihood of having, for once, too much sun. We merely remember that one of the wonderful things about being a human being is that we can imagine anything we choose. We have but three-quarters of an hour to greet our fellow-countrymen living in the groups of small islands which are ' home,' not only to those English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk who live there, but to thousands and thousands all round the world. The glimpse of these islands is soon past, with the bonnie misty high- lands, the soft emerald-green fields, the huge grey cities, whence so many brave souls have gone forth through the years, worthy sons of the 'little mother by the sleepless northern tide.' And then, for full three hours, beneath us surge and swell the waves of the ever-restless sea. Much; indeed, have we to think about, as we watch the lighting up of its face greeting the morning sun, as we watch the white, tossing manes of the sea- horses, the procession of steamers and all kinds of shipping on the ocean highway, and consider the babel of messages by cable under the sea, by air-waves above it, for ever passing backwards and forwards between the Old World and the New. We have always loved Lief the Lucky, the bold, brave Norseman, so affectionate to his old father, and we realise more than ever, as the western ocean rolls beneath us, what a feat his was to breast those waves in his frail boat, and find America five hundred years before Columbus. The echoes of his story of wonder are passed on to us in the minstrel songs round the glowing hearth-fires of our northern ancestors, And then we think how the icebergs went on grinding, and the winds and tempests went on making increasing wild music through the centuries, and perhaps never a sail came near, nor the sound of a human voice was carried over the water till Cabot, the Venetian, who sailed for the first of the Tudor kings of England, put out of Bristol into the unknown West, the mighty dominion appears The land is in sight, the land round the great gate of the continent, though Cabot and his followers little thought of what lay at the back of that beyond! Labrador, the country about the mighty River St. Lawrence, and [Newfoundland] were claimed for Henry VII. by the setting up of a cross, carved with the English arms, by the fluttering out of the English flag to the salt breeze, in the hope that it was the near way to the riches and spices and gems of the East Indies ; but we see, from our airy height, that it is but the edge of the mighty dominion of Canada, as large as Europe, forty times larger than Great Britain. It will take five hours for Canada to roll its whole width before us from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and as yet there are scarcely more people living in it than in Greater London. We give a greeting to many of our fellow-country- men in all parts, and ' bonne annee ' to the French Canadians settled so happily beside them in what was once known as ' Greater France.'", "THE HOUSES BUILT OF SNOW", "The natives of the country are few and far between.

It is all changed now.", "PALEFACES AND REDSKINS", "The palefaces are now a united Canadian nation, living in handsome cities, and  at work peacefully everywhere, cutting down forests, cultivating boundless fields,  driving their tireless iron steeds upon  shining rails from ocean to ocean. It is  pathetic to see the remnants of the red-  skins, so silent and sad-looking, bringing  their bead and leather work for sale at  the stations. There are but a few  thousands left of them. We can find  their names on the map, the Cree and  Yukon Indians, the Sioux and Ojibway,  and others. Many live on reserve  grounds, and are so poor that they have  to be helped with food and clothing, for  the buffalo and other wild animals on  which they depended so much are dying  out, like the redskins themselves. It  is difficult to imagine any happy new  years for the Indians, even for those who  still roam more freely in the wildest and  farthest West. But it is a cheerful crack that we hear  from the cowboy's whip. Of course, we  have all privately wished to be cowboys, riding like the wind over grassy, flowery  plains and hill-sides, on horses that  stand still at a whisper, and have muzzles  soft as velvet. Our happy new year, borne over the wide ranches, seems to  have some point for them, and for the hard-working settlers in their home- steads and the cheery lumbermen in the forests. And now Canada has passed, its eastern edge being that wonderful British Columbia, with its magnificent mountains and fertile growing slopes facing the Pacific Ocean. Once more the water quivers, dances, leaps beneath us—-this time for five long hours, and as the mighty panorama moves along, we see beautiful islands, with palm-trees and flowers, on which live many dusky folk, widely differing in appearance and manners. Some of the finest of the islanders mi- grated long ago to the land we now call New Zealand. This Britain of the South comes into sight when half our day of watching is over. Kara-mea, the land of sweet smells; is one of the native Maori names for it. We are entranced with its beauty. Such mountains and glaciers, hot springs and geysers, tall gum-trees, magnificent farms and pas- tures, and we find our fellow-country- men everywhere. The Maoris fought fiercely to the death against the new- comers—should not we ourselves do the same ?—and there are now but few of these line, brave people left.", "THE GREAT ISLAND CONTINENT PASSES BY", "Then, though we would fain linger among the Maoris, hearing about the way they are taking to education, ex- amining the wonderful carvings on their houses, looking at the extraordinary tattooings on the old chiefs, the world will not stand still for us, and we seem to hear, on the wind, the triumphant words, 'Advance Australia.' The great island- continent, twenty-five times larger than the United Kingdom, takes three hours to pass by ; and here, as in New Zealand and Canada, we see chiefly the descend- ants of countrymen who have travelled far to found new homes. There are now left only a few of the blacks, the old natives who had the whole land to them- selves before the Europeans came with their new animals and plants and the new ways of life, and these surviving natives are as uncivilised as any people on the globe. Many act as helpers on the huge sheep-farms fringing the great waterless desert in the heart of Australia, the oldest land in the world. Many of the poor blacks look as if they had scarcely sense to understand our good wishes, but their eyes sparkle at the present of a few bright beads. For the next hour the familiar flag holds its own on parts of the great mass of islands north and north-west of Australia, and we are kept busy making acquaintance with all sorts of differing types of people in Borneo, in New Guinea, in the long peninsula of Malay, and Ceylon. Then comes India, that immense peninsula pointing south- ward, twelve times larger than the United Kingdom, with seven times as many people in it. The greater part of this vast country, made up of many different states, peopled with men of different races, manners, customs, is now under the rule of the small and distant Great Britain.", "THE PAGEANT OF THE EAST", "Stirring deeds of which we read in history, some bad and sad, some immortal in their grandeur, brought this strange state of things to pass during the days that passed between the reigns of Good Queen Bess and Victoria. Our greetings to our fellow-countrymen in India are quickly over, and to our Indian friends whom we know personally, because they have been to school and college with our brothers and cousins here in England. These are but a few thousands among hundreds of millions. Our hearts fail us as we try to glance rapidly from the grand Himalayas to beautiful Ceylon. We feel we have never understood what a crowd meant before, as we take in the vast gatherings of people who assemble to bathe in the sacred river Ganges, who visit the marvellous temples and shrines, who pass in and out like ants, in the huge cities. Among the surging millions, we distinguish the dazzling magnificence of the princes in silken robes decked with gems ; the brilliance of the rich Parsees; the gorgeous colours of the dresses and turbans of the people in the bazaars and streets, suiting well their dark, handsome faces.", "THE GLITTERING TEMPLES OF INDIA", "As for the priests and the holy men, each one is a startling picture by him- self, and here, there, and everywhere, on the river-banks, in the towns, on the brown and green chessboard of fields and fields and fields as far as the eye can reach, are the workers, toiling day in, day out, millions and millions of them. Their poor lean bodies look like bronze in the sun. Henceforward we will  give the coolies a sympathetic thought as we  drink our Indian tea and coffee, and eat our  rice-pudding! And we know, too, that we are  laying in a store of brilliant memories that  will cheer the dullest, foggiest days we may ever have to straggle with, as we now peer down upon India. Here is a golden temple with doors of silver, glittering in the hot sunshine, mirrored with palaces of marble in the placid pool of Immortality. There stands the most glorious tomb in the world, raised to the memory of a much-loved wife, all dazzling white marble and precious stones, and the exquisite handiwork of twenty thousand workmen during eighteen years! And through the centuries as they pass, the roses and lemon-trees send out their sweet scent, and the birds sing beside the splashing fountains. Hundreds of other temples and monuments, all memorials of the great past, lie in front of us, and before we have half seen them, with the endless variety of life about them, with the lordly and useful elephants, the patient white cattle, and the Riki-tiki-tavi Kipling has made us love—lo and behold, India has rolled past us, and the vast mass of Africa is heaving into view!", "THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE NILE", "Our eyes are bound to be attracted first by the green strip of land in the north-east corner, still in name a part of the dominions of Turkey, but more or less 'influenced' by England. Those stolid field labourers, in their simple cotton tunics—fellaheen—are the living image of their far-away forefathers, pictured on the massive monuments that bridge over sixty centuries on the banks of the Nile. They raise the water, hoe, plant, reap, in much the same way as did their ancestors in the fertile valley ages ago. England is trying to improve their hard life, to lighten their taxes, and make things fairer all round. Southward, past the great dam on the Nile, the little black Nubian children disport themselves fearlessly, like shiny black dolphins, in the river. Through their dusty, desolate country, the railway now stretches to Khartoum, where we see the monument of Gordon on his camel with the handsome trappings, and the college named after him. We have many chances of greeting the Bedouins —the Arab wanderers of the desert— with their camels loaded with their tents and belongings, and their beautiful fleet horses. For over a thousand years,  tribes of Arabs have crossed the Red Sea  and filtered in all directions across the great continent, introducing the Moham-  medan religion and trading, trading  everywhere. In the past there were no  roads in Africa, only paths—paths beaten hard by the naked feet of generation  after generation of slaves, stolen by the  Arabs from their homes to carry on  their heads and shoulders the loads of ivory, palm-oil, and other treasures  gathered up in the dark, unknown  interior, down to the far-distant coasts,  and to be sold—themselves—far beyond  the sea.", "SAVAGES UNDER THE UNION JACK", "Especially do these traders scour the  Soudan—the home of the blacks—and  in parts their evil deeds are not yet  stopped. A twentieth part of all the  dwellers on the earth live in this wide  belt of land across Africa south of the  great desert. Some of these are negroes,  still savage; some are of mixed races, half civilised; there is an immense  number of different tribes and groups  of tribes. Among them we distinguish  the strong, industrious Houssas—traders  and good policemen and soldiers when  trained by French or English, for both  countries have their say in various parts  of the Soudan. We cannot miss, too,  the brave and handsome Bicharis, nick-  named by our soldiers Fuzziwuzzies,  on account of their remarkable hair-  dressing. But we must look southward, for  Africa is passing on, and our day of  inspection will soon be over. In the  belt of enormous forests we seek the  few thousand white people—mission-  aries, traders, rulers—who live scattered  among many millions of blacks. The  little pigmy people are too shy to come  out of the depths of the forest, and  some of the fierce cannibal tribes still  surviving under our flag are scarcely  ready for a peaceful message of goodwill.", "WHITE MAN'S AFRICA", "We can breathe again as we look at  the grand country of the great lakes,  the feeders of the Nile and Congo, the  high mountains snow-capped under the  Equator, and the healthy, high plains,  We find many countrymen settled in  Uganda, and, as we watch the smoke  of the train from the coast, we think  of the thrilling stories of seeing lions travel and other wild animals from the carriage windows.", "THE EMPIRE BOY", "When this great railway was being laid, so wild was the country through which it passed that a lion once leaped into a truck and carried off a workman. Those of us who come of Border stock feel a sort of sympathy with the cattle-lifting Masai, the tall Highlanders of the district, and we should like to linger with those children tending the sheep and goats and with the women in the banana-gardens. But the thunderous roar of the mighty falls on the Zambesi warns us that the white man's Africa, the part that points southward like India, is on view. Europeans share South Africa with many dark-skinned natives of different races. The little bushmen, whose ancestors have left so many remarkable drawings on rocks, are now scattered far and wide, and live chiefly in deserts and caves in far- away places. We find their tall cousins, the Hottentots, once very wild and barbarous, now more or less civilised and beginning to work. The Kaffirs, who came south from the heart of the continent long ago and conquered the Hottentots, live beside them, work- ing in the mines and acting as servants in many households. The very name of Matabele Zulu gives us a thrill of horror —it is so short a time since these savages overran the peaceful vales of the Ma- shonas and others, and dyed the streams with blood. But even the Zulus' are going to school now, and settling down. As we look into one fine town after another, delivering our New Year's message at homesteads on the breezy veldt, at great mines and factories, we marvel at the changes the years have brought, while the brown and black people have been slowly dispossessed of the country once entirely theirs, and Dutch and English have been striving for the mastery. It is difficult to realise that only a few hundred years have  passed since European sailors—for all their boldness—dreaded to sail down  that western coast lest they should fall  over the edge of the world!  Just before our day is ended we sight  the 'Nile of the Blacks,' the great  Niger river, and the western end of the Soudan. Round the Gulf of Guinea—  which gave its name to our old guinea  coin—we see the ports of West Africa,  and sympathise much with our country-  men who have to live there in the heat  and damp and depression. But here,  as everywhere, we find our countrymen, living for the love of their fellow-men here are white men, and women too,  far inland at lonely stations, teaching  and helping the natives who work in the  fields and forests. ' Time is up! ' says Father Time, who  rules the world's travelling arrange- ments. One turn round was what you wished to see, and there is Yar- mouth and the North Foreland.' We are home again, and simply rush to the British n Museum, or any  museum nearer that has a collec- tion of the work and possessions of the peoples we have just glanced at. Here, almost  within touching  distance, are the  fur suits of the Eskimos—the mother wears trousers, too; the baby's play- things; models of the camps and sledges and boats. Here are the wonderful works in beads and bark and grass of the numberless tribes of American  Indians, their tools, and their shoes,  Many fine photographs and models  help us to feel that we are in the  Pacific Islands, and to understand the  Maoris and their old life that is passing,  But we have seen something, in our  one day of watching, greater even than  the British Museum, for we have seen  the wonderful procession of races and  tribes which reaches round the earth,  which is never out of the reach of the  sun, yet which marches on in its millions  under the protection of the British flag.",  "The Soudan, whose people are here represented by several types, was conquered by Egypt nearly a century ago, but the vast territory fell back into barbarism and was only recovered for civilisation when a British army, under Lord Kitchener, captured  Khartoum in 1893."]

          "paragraph": ["Between 1885 and 1914 the leading powers of Europe invaded the continent of Africa with the goal of colonization. This event is known as the Scramble for Africa, which resulted in Great Britain gaining the most influence on the continent. The British colonization of Africa emerged from a variety of motivations, such as the demand for raw materials, protecting trade routes, spreading Christianity, a sense of cultural or racial superiority, and a desire for national glory. In addition, the British felt threatened by other European powers' colonial ambitions, leading them to establish a defensive imperial structure to maintain their power. They also wanted access to the raw materials from their African colonies and established forms of transportation to do so. While the metropole (Britain) benefited from this process, the colonized periphery (African colonies) became dependent on Britian's industrialized economy.", "In Britain, pro-imperialist publications often highlighted the arrival of British technology in Africa as a sign of 'civilization' in contrast to the so-called 'barbarism' of indigenous peoples.  In 1913, Arthur Mee's Childrens Magazine, a leading encyclopedia for British children, published an entry entitled 'A Road of a Thousand Wonders. The Train that Runs Past Lions and Giraffes, and Rushes from Civilsation to Barbarism. A Ride from One End of Africa to the Other.' The entry focuses on the Cape to Cairo Railway, one of Britain's major construction projects in Africa, championed by Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902), governor of British South Africa and leading British imperialist of his day. The line, which was constructed in the decades around 1900, consisted of 4,200 miles of track stretching across British colonial territory from Cape Town, South Africa to Cairo, Egypt, and was intended to transport passengers and goods across the continent.", "This encyclopedia entry, like other imperialist sources of this era, framed the Cape to Cairo Railway in the rhetoric of the 'civilizing mission.' Early in the Scramble for Africa, British colonizers cited humanitarian ideals as the basis of their actions, including an anti-slavery campaign. They claimed to be bringing civilization to indigenous Africans. This ideology, which pro-colonial voices preached in the metropole, covered up the racism, labor exploitation, oppression, and state-sponsored violence that British officials were enacting in their African colonies. While British officials and colonialists pointed to efforts to improve the social, economic, and spiritual wellbeing of the African people in their colonies, anti-imperialists, like John Hobson (1858-1940), an English economist and social scientist, saw right through this and protested the abuse and negative impacts colonialism had on Africa. The corollary to the  'civilizing mission' idea was the notion that indigenous Africans were 'barbaric', needing the advancement of education and cultural development to meet European standards. But in actuality, the metropole was advancing the periphery for their own economic benefit and forcing colonized people to adapt to a British view of a capitalistic Christian society. This entry from the Children's Magazine is significant because, not only does it focus on aspects of technology and colonialism in British Africa, it also reveals racialized colonialist attitudes about cultural differences between British and African peoples."

To them the engines and their moving trains represented so many teams of oxen caged up inside. When the trains stopped, the natives waited with wonder and excitement. “ Why don't you let the oxen out?” they asked, imagining that the white men had chained up bullocks inside the engine and made them drive the trains. Old Hero, in his Alexandrian workshop, was two thousand years before his time—the children of the desert and the children of the forests are two thousand years behind. Yet the railway is for them, and could not have been built without their aid....", "It passes the graves of 30,000 poor, foolish people who, on the advice of their witch doctor, slew their cattle and left themselves to perish, because the medicine man had told them a god would arise from the earth to drive the white men to the sea and give their riches to the natives....", "From the Lands of Savagrey to the Lands of Gold", "It rushes from savagery and the silent splendours of Nature to the lands of gold and diamonds, and finally it comes to the end of its journey at the foot of the continent, at Cape Town, with the blue waters of the Atlantic tossing and heaving as they tossed and heaved when Cleopatra was queen of the north, and the south was wrapped in mystery and terror which no man dare explore....", "The Line of Steel that is Coming Fast in the Steps of Livingstone", "The whole history of the colonisation of this vast continent has, indeed, been compressed into the story of the building of this line....", "How a Steam-Engine was Packed Up and Carried Along a Wire", "When the River Kafue came to be crossed there was great difficulty in getting the native work-men to go down in the hollow steel piers which were sunk in the water. It seemed too terrible to them to work under a river, and when they did go down, and a little water leaked into the piers, they fled in a panic of fear....", "Far worse than this, however, were the experiences of the builders of the Uganda line. The camp of the workers was besieged night after night by man-eating lions. Every night a man, perhaps two men, would be carried off. It was in vain that Englishmen sat up to keep watch; the lions were too cunning to be caught by traps, too wily to go the way by which they seemed to know they were expected....", "At last the natives became so terrified that they refused to go on with the work unless surrounded, day and night, with iron entrenchments. With the British Empire behind them, the builders of the railway were helpless in the presence of two man-eating lions, for there were but two of them at this point. For three weeks not a sleeper was laid, not a rivet was driven; the whole camp was under fear of death from the lions. We can under-stand something of their horror, for at that camp fifty-five men were killed and eaten....", "The Fight Against an Enemy Which Destroys Thousands of Lives", "There are thousands of people in Africa who have never seen a cart, whose first journey will be taken by a railway train. Hitherto African travel has been mainly on foot, sometimes in ox-waggons, rarely on horse-back. Travellers have been carried in hammocks, slung over the shoulders of negroes; they have crossed rivers and lakes in boats which the hippopotamus has delighted to toss into the air ; they have tramped on foot for weeks together through forests so dense that the sun cannot penetrate them ; they have been carried or have struggled breast-high in swamps; they have made their way almost buried in the towering elephant-grass or among the lacerating scrub and thorn....", "But, although Africa is so vast that ages must elapse before railways can be general, the old order is changing, giving place to new. Where trains are, trade will spring up. There are diamonds and gold, coal and precious minerals, tin and copper and platinum, fruits, rubber, oils, nuts, fibres, ivory, hides, furs, and a thousand other things waiting to come from Africa to the markets of the world. The railways will bring them, and the 'Dark Continent' will become the centre of a world-wide commerce. It will be free, too, for where the railway goes slavery can never again arise. The railway, like the advance guard of civilisation, comes like the answer to David Livingstone's prayer, ending for ever ignorance and slavery, and opening up to light and freedom the homes of unknown millions. Africa, the dark, deep mystery of the past, is one of the mighty hopes of the years to come...."]

			"One of the greatest romances of all time is being writtten in iron and steel from end to end of the African continent, where men are slowly building up a line of communication which we call the Cape to Cairo Railway. The very name of the railway is thrilling, for it means piercing the heart of this vast, mysterious continent. It will stretch for a distance of over 5600 miles, more than a fifth of the entire circumference of the earth ; it will link together by the bond of civilisation varying conditions such as can be found nowhere else in the world. The work itself will represent the highest skill of the foremost engineers in the world, reaching into places where civilisation has hardly yet begun to dawn. The line will begin in British territory, it will end in British territory, and there is a romantic possibility that every inch of the line will actually run on British soil.", 
			"At the Egyptian end the railway will pass through the Land of the Pharaohs. It will pass—indeed it already passes for the Egyptian part is complete—through scenes in which the earliest civilisation developed—where men built great cities and wrought sculptures which are still among the chief wonders of the world ; where the first great school of learning grew into being while men in England were living in caves, fighting with beasts, eating nuts and berries and the wild herbs of the field. This railway may cross the very footprints of Jesus, for He was taken into Egypt in His child-hood to escape the wrath of Herod, who sought to slay Him. It will pass through the scenes of the life of Moses ; it will carry grain and riches and means of life across the land which Joseph saved from famine ; and it will touch, at Alexandria, the place in which, as far as we know, steam was first made to be the obedient servant of man.", 
			"The great engines will snort and puff and draw their heavy loads where Hero used to walk, the Hero who invented the first steam-engine, and made it open and shut the doors of the temple, so that the astonished people imagined that spirits turned the wheels.", 
			"Now let the mind leap forward two thousand years, and see how little the uncultured human mind changes. When Lord Kitchener was building his railway in the wild Sudan, his work was watched by men such as had come, after the last of the Pharaohs, under the sway of the Greeks and Romans. The ancestors of these men thought that Hero had imprisoned a spirit in his little engine working at the temple. And the Arabs watching Lord Kitchener build-ing his railway thought exactly the same, one old Arab chief solemnly pro-testing to Lord Kitchener that it was cruel to make the spirit in so small an engine drag so many trucks! At the same time, at the other end of the con-tinent, the railway was built in Mata-beleland, where black,' naked warriors, ignorant as were the British in Egypt's great days, dwelt in childish simplicity.", 
			"What thought they of the white men's fire horses? To them the engines and their moving trains represented so many teams of oxen caged up inside. When the trains stopped, the natives waited with wonder and excitement. ' Why don't you let the oxen out?' they asked, imagining that the white men had chained up bullocks inside the engine and made them drive the trains. Old Hero, in his Alexandrian workshop, was two thousand years before his time—the children of the desert and the children of the forests are two thousand years behind. Yet the railway is for them, and could not have been built without their aid.", 
			"The contrast between these two kinds of people give us a clue to the changing scene through which the great line passes—just a clue and no more. For, starting in the' north, where Egypt with its buried treasures lies, the line goes south across historic battlefields, where teeming armies fought for thirty years and Gordon fell a martyr. The shining steel runs on and on to the great lakes of Equatorial Africa ; it passes through dim forest lands where pygmies dwell ; it rushes through the haunts of lions which sometimes try to tear the drivers from the engines, through the homes of the rhinoceros and hippopotamus, and past places where jackals and hyenas howl at nights and mumble the bones of dead giraffes. It passes the graves of 30,000 poor, foolish people who, on the advice of their witch doctor, slew their cattle and left themselves to perish, because the medicine man had told them a god would arise from the earth to drive the white men to the sea and give their riches to the natives. It touches a lake three-quarters the size of Ireland, and another 2670 feet up in the air. It crosses the mighty Zambesi near the matchless Victoria Falls, where the sun makes rainbows all day long in the spray.", 
			"From the Lands of Savagrey to the Lands of Gold", 
			"It rushes from savagery and the silent splendours of Nature to the lands of gold and diamonds, and finally it comes to the end of its journey at the foot of the continent, at Cape Town, with the blue waters of the Atlantic tossing and heaving as they tossed and heaved when Cleopatra was queen of the north, and the south was wrapped in mystery and terror which no man dare explore.", 
			"That is the Cape to Cairo Railway, not as it is, for it is not yet completed, but as it will be when the links now missing are forged. But it will never, perhaps, be a continuous line. No single train will go the whole way. For even when the line is finished we shall leave the train and sail some distance on the great inland waters, on lakes and on the bosom of the Nile. While this great railway backbone for a continent is being built from north to south, lines running east and west will serve to link it up with other parts. The Uganda Railway is already complete, run-ning from Mombassa, on the south-east coast, north-west to the inland sea which we call Lake Victoria Nyanza, a body of water 26,000 square miles in extent.", 
			"The Great Dream of David Livingstone that is Now Being Realised", 
			"On the west coast a line runs inland from Lobito Bay, in Portuguese Angola. So far 250 miles of this line have been built, and it is being hurried on to join a branch of the Cape to Cairo Railway at Kambove, in the Katanga district of the Congo Free State. It is hoped that here we may obtain possession of a narrow strip of land from the Belgians, the owners of the Congo Free State, enabling the line to continue its way into Northern Rhodesia over British territory. But The line from Lobito Bay will be more than a tributary of the greater line. It will be carried on to link up with a railway already running inland from the east coast at Beira: With that complete we shall for the first time have a line actually crossing Africa.", 
			"One of Livingstone's dreams will be realised when that is accomplished. When he was on the first of his great journeys through the land of mystery, he came upon a mighty river, 300 yards broad, right in the heart of the country. To his joy he that it was the Zambesi, which had been supposed to rise hundreds of miles to the east of this point, quite near the east coast. The heart of Livingstone leapt with gladness. ' Now I know there is a water-way to the east coast,' he said. But he did not follow it at once. He turned his face to the west. ' I must find a highway from the west coast,' he said, ' for it is to the west coast that English ships will come, to bring money and goods in exchange for the things the natives have to offer. Once a proper trade is established, we shall end the slave trade.'", 
			"The Line of Steel that is Coming Fast in the Steps of Livingstone", 
			"He knew that regular commerce would prevent men from selling their women and children to the slave-dealers, and he knew that by finding a highway and establishing a proper route the brutal slave-raiders would no longer dare to carry fire and sword into the secret places of the land, to burn down villages and carry their people away captive. When he had found his way out on the west coast, Livingstone turned about and marched across the continent to the east coast, and it is thril-ling to know that the first railway across the continent will follow practically in his steps. Lobito Bay, on the west coast, is near Loanda, where Livingstone came out.; Beira, on the east coast, is near Quilimane, where he found himself after his great march to the east. He yearned for a railway along that route. It is coming, building fast. But his son, Tom Livingstone, said to a friend, ' Let us go from Cairo to the Cape and preach a railway. It shall be called Livingstone's Line.'", 
			"That line, too, is coming as fast as men can build it, but it is called the Cape to Cairo Railway. The making of these railways in Africa stands for more than anything that has been done by engineers before. The line runs through deserts where there is no water. It runs across rivers and gorges and chasms. It runs up hill, down dale, and skirts mountains ; it goes through forests and thickets where only wild beasts and wild men have their habitations. For a great part of the way the line has fol-lowed the track of men who went on just ahead, surveying and mapping a way as they travelled. The route for the railway was planned while the line was actually being built. Material has had to be made in England, Scotland, and Wales, bridges built in England and put up, then taken to pieces and packed in boxes and sent to African ports to be carried up country by bullock waggon, by railway, and by caravans of porters. Every tool has had to cross the sea, every engine has been carried out in pieces and put to-gether on the spot. Mysterious ill-nesses have seized the engineers, sleeping sickness and deadly fevers have attacked the men; lions have killed and carried off scores of workers, the ter-rible ' white ants ' have eaten the tele-graph poles ,and railway sleepers ; elephants have knocked over en-gines, and natives have been hostile and dishonest. War has raged at both ends of the line since the work was started. The whole history of the colonisation of this vast continent has, indeed, been compressed into the story of the building of this line.", 
			"It makes us proud to reflect that, in spite of all these difficulties, the work has gone steadily on, until now, starting from the Cape, the line runs northward to Elizabeth-ville, 2300 miles from Cape Town, and, starting southward from Cairo, the line runs for hundreds of miles south of Khar-toum. It needs but the addition of about 900 miles of railway to enable us to say that we can travel by steam from one end of the African continent to the other.", 
			"Let us see what the route actually is. We start from Cape Town, and run up through Cape Colony to Kimberley, in British Beehuanaland, on to Mafeking, and across the Kalahari Desert to Bulawayo, in Matabeleland, which is now part of the vast territory called Rhodesia. Then we turn north-west and cross the Zambesi at Victoria Falls, after which we bear to the north-east and run right up Northern Rhodesia until we come to what we will call its middle boundary. Here, for the first time, our line leaves British territory. It strikes north-east into the Congo Free State up to Elizabethville, and there, for the moment, it stays. We have left British territory then, after over 2300 miles.", 
			"By bearing sharply away to the north-east we could still keep on British territory for some distance farther, but here, at the northern limit of the western half of Rhodesia, we have a wedge of the Congo Free State dividing British territory. This great Congo State belongs to Belgium, and con-tinues side by side with the western frontier of North-ern Rhodesia, then along the left or west bank of Lake Tanganyika, right away to the south-ern boundary of the Sudan. But at the northern end of the lake it marches side by side with British East Africa, in which Uganda is included. Now it is proposed that Belgium shall give Great Britain a narrow strip of land along the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, so enabling us to run the railway on British territory right to the lake. Lake Tan-ganyika itself is open to the vessels of all nations, so that we can continue our journey by steamer to its northern limit, after which we should use Lake Albert Nyanza and other watercourses in the same way, so reaching British East Africa and then the Sudan. From here we have the splendid Nile waterway, on which steamers are always plying, until we reach the railway which takes us into Khartoum, now a marvel of civilisation, once the great slave mart of the Sudan. From Khartoum we ride the whole way by train to Cairo, and our wonderful journey is at an end.", 
			"We have now only to bridge the distance between Rhodesia and Lake Tanganyika, and to fill in one or two other gaps, and the line through the heart of wealth and splendour, through savagery and wilderness, through terrors and mysteries all wonderful, will be finished.", 
			"The Great Man who Lies on the Heights of the Matoppo Hills", 
			"It is a dazzling scheme, and we owe it mainly to one man, Cecil Rhodes, who lies now buried in a stately tomb on the heights of the Matoppo Hills, past which the railway runs. Mr. Rhodes went out to South Africa as a young man and an invalid, recovered his health in the fine bracing climate he found there, engaged in gold and diamond mining, came home and finished his educa-tion at Oxford University, then went back and gave himself entirely to the develop-ment of South Africa. When he took up railway building, the line extended only to Vryburg. Rhodes raised money and carried it first to Mafeking and then on to Bulawayo, which, until a little while before, had been the head village of a terrible Matabele warrior, King Lobengula.", 
			"It is now the capital of the great territory of Rhodesia, which, with its 440,000 square miles, nearly equals the area of Germany and Austria-Hungary put together. After reaching Bulawayo, Rhodes had difficulty in raising money enough to carry on the work, for the cost was enormous, even to a millionaire, as he had then become.", 
			"Where the Great Zambesi River Falls into a Yawning Gulf", 
			"But, little by little, the work grew. Here a goldfield was discovered, here a copper- mine, here valuable coal or other minerals were found. The line was thus drawn this way and that, simply to tap districts rich in metals, and so make it pay as soon as possible. This accounts for the strange way in which the railway zigzags on its long course. It was the existence of a valuable coalfield at Wankie that drew it far to the west from Bulawayo. At first it was in-tended to build only a small branch line here, but ultimately it was decided to make it the main line, and, that determined, there lay ahead the great Zambesi and the Victoria Falls.", 
			"There was no turning back ; the river had to be spanned. That being so, the line was made to cross, at its narrowest point, within sight of the falls, the largest in the world. There is one waterfall in British Guiana higher, but not so wide. The Victoria Falls are a mile wide and 400 feet high—higher than the top of St. Paul's Cathedral. We should expect that there would be a great drop in the land below the falls, but that is not the case ; the banks of the river are the same height above and below. The river falls into an enormous crevice in the earth, descending with a noise like thunder into a deep but very narrow fissure, throwing up clouds of spray, so that natives, who used to be afraid to approach before Livingstone discovered the falls, named it ' The Smoke that Sounds.'", 
			"A magnificent piece of engineering threw a great bridge across this narrow chasm. First a small electric station was set up at the foot of the falls, the power from the running water supplying energy to drive the plant. Then a wire cable was hauled across the river, and suspended over the gulf. Across this, loads upon loads of material were sent over, ten tons at a time.", 
			"How a Steam-Engine was Packed Up and Carried Along a Wire", 
			"A steam locomotive was sent across this' carrier, a piece at a time. When all was ready a hundred native labourers, under twenty-five English engineers, were set to work, building out the bridge from the two sides of the gorge at once. It was built as regularly as clockwork, the great steel arms growing out from both sides simultaneously. The work was begun in October, 1904, and was finished in nineteen weeks, perhaps the quickest piece of bridge-building on record. As the bridge neared completion there was much excitement, for the least mistake would have been serious, but the two halves met exactly ; there had not been a miscalculation of an eighth of an inch. The bridge is the highest in the world, 420 feet above the boiling water below, and is 650 feet in length.", 
			"That was not the only exciting piece of work on this part of the line. When the River Kafue came to be crossed there was great difficulty in getting the native work-men to go down in the hollow steel piers which were sunk in the water. It seemed too terrible to them to work under a river, and when they did go down, and a little water leaked into the piers, they fled in a panic of fear. There was no electric cable for this river, but before they got their bridge built the engineers wanted a loco-motive on the other side. They ferried it across entire on a gigantic pontoon.", 
			"But worse than water and its bothering ways were the wild animals. Once a great rhinoceros, annoyed at the sight of a little engine puffing about,' took it into its head to charge the locomotive. The engine-driver, seeing the animal coming, put on steam and fled, but not soon enough to prevent the rhinoceros from catching the guard's van with its mighty horn and tearing half of the vehicle into splinters. At another place a herd of elephants used nightly to cross the line to go to their drinking place. All went well until one night something disturbed the temper of the leader of the herd, and, with a shrill scream of anger, he charged at the engine and knocked it off the line. But as it fell the engine im-prisoned the elephant, holding it down by the foot, so that the lord of the herd had to be shot before the engine could be set right.", 
			"Lions, however, were the greatest source of terror. On one occasion a full-grown male, roused from his nap by the whistle of the train, dashed at the engine and tried to claw it. Failing to get a grip, it fell off, but returned to the charge again and again, each time getting out of harm's way as it fell, until at last the driver rushed his engine at the lion and killed it.", 
			"Far worse than this, however, were the experiences of the builders of the Uganda line. The camp of the workers was besieged night after night by man-eating lions. Every night a man, perhaps two men, would be carried off. It was in vain that Englishmen sat up to keep watch ; the lions were too cunning to be caught by traps, too wily to go the way by which they seemed to know they were expected. Fires were kept burning, but the lions would leap over them ; great defences of thorn bushes were set up, but the lions got through or over them. Every night the camp resounded with dreadful cries as some unhappy victim was seized and carried from his bed to be eaten in the long grass. At last the natives became so terrified that they refused to go on with the work unless surrounded,, day and night, with iron entrenchments. With the British Empire behind them, the builders of the railway were helpless in the presence of two man-eating lions, for there were but two of them at this point. For three weeks not a sleeper was laid, not a rivet was driven ; the whole camp was under fear of death from the lions. We can under-stand something of their horror, for at that camp fifty-five men were killed and eaten before a brave Englishman, Colonel Patter-son, hid himself high up in a tree, tied up a donkey as a bait, and shot first one and then the other lion. They were huge beasts, but, like all the man-eaters of their tribe, they were old, their teeth had lost their sharpness, and they could no longer catch the swift-running buck or zebra.", 
			"The Mysterious Shadow Moving Across the Line by Night", 
			"All went well for a time after this, but when the line had been carried another 120 miles another series of raids took place, and fifteen men were eaten. Three men—two English and one Italian—then detached a little saloon carriage from a train, fixed it in a siding, and determined to watch for the lion at night. They sat in the dark in their saloon, waiting and watching. They noticed that farther down the line the fireflies seemed unusually large, and they thought it strange that a rat should keep running across the lines. But the ' fireflies ' were the eyes of a lion gleaming in the moonlight; the ' rat ' was his tail dragging across the metals as he strode from side to side! Presently the watchers, tired with their long day's labour, fell asleep, and suddenly there was a great crash, the carriage tilted to one side, and a gigantic lion sprang through the open window. The Italian, who was sleeping on the floor, awoke with a great weight upon his body and hearing heart-rending cries. The lion was standing with its hind legs on his chest while it seized one of the Englishmen from a bed above. It turned, leapt out of the window with the unhappy man in its mouth, and was seen no more.", 
			"Mr. D. G. Longworth, the London repre-sentative of the Uganda Railway, who was telling these stories to the writer, pointed to a photograph of two lions. ' Those are the two that ate the fifty-five men,' he said.", 
			"The Influence of the Railway on the Wild Life of Africa", 
			"He was asked if the Italian in the railway carriage survived the shock. ' Oh, yes! ' said Mr. Longworth. ' He was in here yesterday, quite as usual. But,' he added, ' we don't mind lions out there in the ordinary way. They are only big cats, and unless they are old, and therefore not very active, they will always run away when you meet them. You have nothing to fear from a good lion, only from the old ones. We had a man taken from the little station of Voy a few weeks ago, in broad daylight. He was one of the servants of an Indian prince who was out hunting, and while his master was at lunch the man lay down on the platform for a rest. As he lay there an old lion crept out from the scrub, and, before anyone could fire a shot, carried the man away and ate him.'", 
			"It is generally supposed that the coming of the railway leads to the extinction of wild life in a new country, but Mr. Longworth says that this is not so on the Uganda Railway. No one is allowed to kill an animal within a mile of the line, and the result is that the neighbourhood of the railway has become a sort of sanctuary for them. Lions and other animals have in-creased greatly in numbers. They have learned now that they have nothing to fear from the railway, and they increase in peace.", 
			"Uganda is the home of sleeping sickness, which medical men are now studying on the spot, and Mr. Longworth tells an interesting story of the way in which the Uganda Railway Company successfully fights the disease. Sleeping sickness is caused in man by the bite of a mosquito carrying a deadly germ, and this mosquito can only be hatched in water or damp places. What the rail-way authorities have done is to prevent anybody from living within two miles of the lake—the great Victoria Nyanza— and all around the banks of the lake, where the railway runs, they planted sweet potatoes.", 
			"The Fight Against an Enemy Which Destroys Thousands of Lives", 
			"These kill off the swampy growths which formerly existed, dry up the soil, and make it no longer possible for the death-dealing mosquito to breed there. In such simple ways do clever men check a disease which has slain hundreds of thousands of people within a few years. Of course, the Uganda Railway is not on the route of the Cape to Cairo, but it is a very important feeder of the continental line, and can easily be reached from the Sudan. It is a wonderful piece of work.", 
			"We all look to the Cape to Cairo Railway as a great help in the peaceful development of Africa. But war has followed its track. The southern part of the work was inter-rupted by the Boer War ; the northern half was begun for the purpose of war. Before 1882 Egypt had for sixty years been gradually extending her influence over the Sudan, but then for sixteen years a Dervish fanatic, called the Mahdi, and the Khalifa, who had been one of his officers, held the country in a desolating tyranny. They closed the Sudan to civilisation ; they massacred, made slaves, blotted out whole communities, and turned the Sudan into a wilderness. General Gordon, who had been sent out by the British Govern-ment to rescue the native Egyptian garrisons and those dependent upon them, was besieged in Khartoum, and finally slain there. British forces sent to punish the offenders were cut to pieces, and the position of affairs was dreadful until Lord Kitchener appeared upon the scene.", 
			"He had to break the power of the Dervishes. His starting point was Cairo, but the Khalifa's stronghold was 1200 miles south, across waterless deserts. All the king's horses and all the king's men could not have reached the enemy, for food and water and stores had to be carried all the way. So Lord Kitchener built a railway, and carried his army along it. He had to fight tremendous battles on the way, so that his men may be said to have worked like the builders of the Temple, with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other. The rail-way began at Wady Haifa, and was laid on to Khartoum, and the line constructed as a pathway for an army is now part of the northern link in the chain which is to join Cairo to the Cape.", 
			"Such are some of the features and history of this marvellous undertaking. There are thousands of people in Africa who have never seen a cart, whose first journey will be taken by a railway train. Hitherto African travel has been mainly on foot, sometimes in ox-waggons, rarely on horse-back. Travellers have been carried in hammocks, slung over the shoulders of negroes ; they have crossed rivers and lakes in boats which the hippopotamus has delighted to toss into the air ; they have tramped on foot for weeks together through forests so dense that the sun cannot penetrate them ; they have been carried or have struggled breast-high in swamps; they have made their way almost buried in the towering elephant-grass or among the lacerating scrub and thorn.", 
			"But, although Africa is so vast that ages must elapse before railways can be general, the old order is changing, giving place to new. Where trains are, trade will spring up. There are diamonds and gold, coal and precious minerals, tin and copper and platinum, fruits, rubber, oils, nuts, fibres, ivory, hides, furs, and a thousand other things waiting to come from Africa to the markets of the world. The railways will bring them, and the ' Dark Continent ' will become the centre of a world-wide commerce. It will be free, too, for where the railway goes slavery can never again arise. The railway, like the advance guard of civilisation, comes like the answer to David Livingstone's prayer, ending for ever ignorance and slavery, and opening up to light and freedom the homes of unknown millions. Africa, the dark, deep mystery of the past, is one of the mighty hopes of the years to come."]

          "paragraph": ["On the surface, this encyclopedia article for children explains why the British ruled India. Published in 1911, it focuses on efforts to maintain British control in India. Before formal colonialism, India was governed by the British East India Company from 1757 to 1857. This was a joint stock company with many investors and a goal of profit. It was involved in many enterprises including the coffee, cotton, and tea trades. Then in 1857, large numbers of sepoys, Indian soldiers in the East India Company's service, revolted. While the revolt did not successfully overthrow the Company's rule, it shocked the British Parliament into removing the East India Company from power and setting up a crown colony, which became known as the British Raj. The crown colony allowed for direct rule. Queen Victoria and her successors began to refer to themselves as Emperors and Empresses of India, evoking the tradition of the Mughal Empire that had ruled India during the early modern period.", "By the late nineteenth century, however, many Indians had grown disillusioned with British rule and began to demand a reformed government that allowed for greater indigenous representation in the Raj. India's National Congress, which was the main Indian nationalist organization had been gaining momentum since its inception in 1885, and the All-India Muslim League, an Indian nationalist group that advocated for Muslim interests, was founded just five years before this encyclopedia was published. The British Raj lasted until 1947 when British imperial rule finally came to an end.", "When reading this text, we must keep in mind that colonialism and imperialism were not seen as the evils that many people see them as today. Those in the British Empire who supported the practices of imperialism often saw themselves as saviors and Christianizers who were doing God's work. Therefore, this primary source opens a window into the ideology and philosophy of colonialism and imperialism that would have been popular among many people in Britian who were in support of the British Raj. It should be noted that the article's title itself is false colonialist propaganda. In reality, India had a deep and complex history of indigenous self-government prior to the arrival of the British Empire."]

Now, there is still another very big slice of our Empire which is governed in a different way from all the rest. This slice is what we call our great Dependency of India. In calling India a Dependency we mean that it depends upon us to rule over it and keep peace within it, and to protect it against enemies. And we mean also that it is not free to go its own way ; that it is not an independent State....", "Now, there is another thing we must understand. The people of India have never governed themselves. They have always been ruled over by kings in the same kind of way as were the people of the kingdoms and empires that we read about in the Old Testament; kings who generally made it the business of their lives to conquer other kingdoms and add them to their own dominions. There have always been a great many kings in India, though there has sometimes been an emperor to whom all or most of them were subject. But there is only one bit of India, called Rajputana, where one single family has managed to keep the throne for a very long time. Either the kings have been overthrown by neighbouring kings who conquered them, or some successful general has rebelled, and seized the throne for himself and his descendants, until some other rebel, or some other conqueror, usurped the throne in his turn.", "Outside Rajputana, among all the rajahs in India, there is hardly one whose dynasty began to reign so long as two hundred years ago. The Moguls themselves, who were Emperors of all India until the British became what is called the paramount Power, were foreigners from outside, who began their conquest only when Henry VIII. was King of England.", "Such is the great country of which we Britons gradually became the masters, and over which we rule. There are some two hundred thousand white people in the middle of a population of close on four hundred millions of dark-skinned people, and this little host of white people are the rulers. How do we do it?...", "The Governor-General and his Council control the whole administration in the same way as the Ministers do in England; but the position of the Viceroy is much more like that of the Prime Minister than like that of the King in the Cabinet, though in other respects he is more like the King. There is also a Legislative Council, some members of which are Indians. The consent of the Legislative Council is required for legislation; but it is not at all like a Parliament elected by the people of India. The Governor-General in Council along with the Legislative Council is the supreme Government of all India, subject only to the control exercised by the Government in England through the Secretary of State for India.", "Next, we must understand that India falls into two big divisions. In one division are all the provinces and districts which are under the direct administration of the British. In the other division are the native States where the British do not govern, but only control the Government, in the same kind of way that the home Government controls the Government of India, but does not itself do the governing. In this division there are an immense number of princes, some with big and some with small territories…", "There is always a possibility that if we had a serious quarrel with some great Power in Europe, that Power might try to attack India. That is one reason why we have to keep a very big army there. Another reason is that, like everyone else who has ever ruled in India, we should cease to be rulers unless we had an army which would be strong enough to make it impossible for a rebellion to be successful.", "So, out of all the white people in India, about one in every three is a soldier; and, besides these soldiers, there are about twice as many native soldiers, who are called Sepoys. All the officers of the Sepoy regiments are white men of our own race.", "At one time there were about five Sepoys to every British soldier in India; and then, when the Sepoys mutinied and rose up against us, we had a very difficult business to hold our own. But now we can count on them to be loyal; and even if they did want to rebel they would find it very much more difficult to do so than it was before.", "That is the first point. We keep the Government of India because we have an army which is strong enough to make it secure. The next point is that, as we have to do the governing, we want our rule to be strictly just and fair, and to benefit the people of India as much as possible, so that they shall be happy and contented under our rule. Our object is, not to make India European, but to organise and add to its own good laws and to do away with those that are bad…"]

In calling India a Dependency we mean that it depends upon us to rule over it and keep peace within it, and to protect it against enemies. And we mean also that it is not free to go its own way ; that it is not an independent State.", "In India there are nearly ten times as many people as there are in the British Islands ; yet not one in a thousand belongs to our own race ; and only about five in a thousand profess the Christian religion. Three-quarters of them are Hindus, most of whom believe in all sorts of strange gods ; while, of the rest, the greater number are Mohammedans, who believe in God, the God of whom the Bible tells us in the Old Testament. But, instead of believing in Jesus Christ, they believe that Mohammed was the true prophet of God, and that salvation belongs to his followers.", "Not only are the natives of India very different from ourselves ; but there are many vastly different races among them, races which are just as different as the different peoples of Europe. Even in one province, like the great district of the Punjab, the people called Sikhs and the people called Pathans are quite as unlike each other as a Scottish Highlander and a man from Kent. The Bengali and the Maratha are as different as the German and the Italian ; and. the Ghurka from the Himalayas is as different from the rest as a Frenchman is from other Europeans. And so on all over the country. Yet at the same time all the Indians have a likeness, something common to them all, which no Europeans have ; just as all Europeans have something in common which no Indians have.", "Now, there is another thing we must understand.

There are some two hundred thousand white people in the middle of a population of close on four hundred millions of dark-skinned people, and this little host of white people are the rulers. How do we do it?", "THE VICEROY AND THE NATIVE PRINCES", "We have set up a Government in India. It is not the least like the Government in the Dominions and Colonies. At the head of it there is a Viceroy, who represents the Emperor ; for King George V. has the title of Emperor of India. The Viceroy, or Governor-General, as he is also called, has a Council, appointed by the authority of the Government of England.", "The Governor-General and his Council control the whole administration in the same way as the Ministers do in England ; but the position of the Viceroy is much more like that of the Prime Minister than like that of the King in the Cabinet, though in other respects he is more like the King.

In the other division are the native States where the British do not govern, but only control the Government, in the same kind of way that the home Government controls the Government of India, but does not itself do the governing. In this division there are an immense number of princes, some with big and some with small territories. The biggest of them all is the Mohammedan prince who is called the Nizam of Hyderabad. He is ruler over a large territory called the Deccan, in the northern part of the southern half of India.", " Most of the other princes who have big territories have the title of Maharajah, while the lesser princes are generally called Rajah. At the Court of each important prince there is a British Resident or Agent appointed by the supreme Government, whose business it is to give advice, and to see that in matters of importance the advice is followed. In other cases there may be an Agent or Commissioner in charge of a large district in which there are several princes.", " The princes are allowed to have their own troops, but only within limits as to numbers ; and they are not allowed to make treaties or agreements with other princes or with foreign Powers ; so that if any of them were disaffected toward the British rule it would be very difficult for them to combine to make a rebellion. Their troops are really only a kind of police, though they might become very useful as soldiers if we were engaged in a foreign war for the defence of India.", "As far as concerns the government by these princes within their own territories, the supreme Government requires only that it shall be reasonably just and orderly, and in a general way loyal to the British. No one would be allowed to upset the dynasty and seize the throne. The British Government settles all questions of succession, and would allow no one but itself to depose a ruler or appoint his successor.", " The succession goes by fixed legal rules, and those rules the British would enforce if any attempt were made to break them. Now we will look at the other work Government of India has to do. First, it has to attend to the countries which border on India, and to do whatever is necessary to keep them on friendly terms, or to fight them if they make fighting necessary.", "There is always a possibility that if we had a serious quarrel with some great Power in Europe, that Power might try to attack India. That is one reason why we have to keep a very big army there. Another reason is that, like everyone else who has ever ruled in India, we should cease to be rulers unless we had an army which would be strong enough to make it impossible for a rebellion to be successful.", "So, out of all the white people in India, about one in every three is a soldier ; and, besides these soldiers, there are about twice as many native soldiers, who are called Sepoys.

Our object is, not to make India European, but to organise and add to its own good laws and to do away with those that are bad.", "Of course, in a country so huge as India, with its various peoples and States and religions, people in different parts of it have been accustomed to different laws. For that reason, among others, India is divided up into different Presidencies and Governorships and Lieutenant-Governorships, all of them exercising a great deal of power, having administrations of their own, and legislative powers, of their own, subject to the supreme Government.", "So there are two great branches of the public service which do the work of governing under the direction of the administration : the military branch and the Civil Service. The Indian Civil Service is open to all subjects of the King, including natives of India, and admittance is gained by examination. What the men in the Civil Service are concerned with mostly has to do either with collecting revenue or with administering justice, seeing that the right people pay the right taxes, and that the laws are properly kept. Both soldiers and civil servants are employed on what is called in India “political” work—that is, as Residents and Agents among the native princes.", "But there are all sorts of other things which among them they have to look after, such as what are called public works, making roads and bridges and canals and railways ; and many things which would be carried out in England by private people as a matter of business have to be done in India by the Government, because no one could expect to make enough money to give him a living by doing them on his own account."]

          "paragraph": ["In 1757, when Commander Robert Clive of the East India Trading Company's military defeated Nawab of Bengel of the Mughal Empire, he set the widely accepted historical precedent for British colonial influence in India. The East India Trading Company was a private trade corporation which had close ties to the British Government, and it ruled India through military force. This status quo remained until the Rebellion of 1857, in which indigenous Indians recruited in the Bengal Army, a British military force, rose in mutiny against the East India Trade Company with the hope of driving out Western influences. This rebellion was unsuccessful, and as a result, the British Parliament pronounced India as a formal crown colony. A system of governance was then established by Parliament called the British Raj. It was an occupational government that consisted primarily of British officers and politicians, and it lasted from 1858 to 1947. While local Indian rulers cooperated with the British Empire, the relationship they had was asymmetrical in favor of the British largely due to the newly established Raj.", "Concurrent with these developments, travelogues also emerged as a popular source of spreading information of perceived exotic places to European audiences. These could range from full book-length publications meant to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, to more niche recordings only meant for particular peoples, like families or certain organizations. The main dominating feature of these travelogues is that they feature a firsthand, often very personalized account of travel through a foreign land, recording the features and elements that stood out to the author. As a result of the very personalized nature of these travelogues, they are often biased with the author's personal world views and ideals, which often bleed into the text.", "This article of Children's Magazine, published in London in 1912, was part of a broader British encyclopedia series meant for children. This issue features a travelogue of India, detailing the land and its people, their native faiths, and prospective job opportunities in the British Raj for aspiring young British boys and girls. It explores India and describes both the mundane and the unique, from nameless villages and marketplaces to iconic locations such as the Taj Majal. The way this information is presented by the travelogue paints a perspective that heavily features themes of British colonialism and Imperialism, and as a result provides an interesting lens into how imperialist British society viewed their presence in India."]

India is going to be as wide-awake as Japan, and some of you ought to be there to see that great event and help it to a long day's hap- piness. So, how would you like... But first of all you must know what India is really like. Well, to begin with, directly his steamer gets to the Suez Canal the traveller feels that he is in a new world. The sun is much hotter, the light is more dazzling, the air glows and throbs with the intensity of its radiance. It is almost impossible to sleep in a cabin through the Red Sea, and most people lie on deck at night with nothing but a sheet over them. Slowly the air cools as the traveller approaches Bombay, and at first, in the cold dawn of his arrival, he is inclined to think that India is very little different from any other country in the West on a summer's day. It looks flat and colourless ; just a line of broken islands; a smoky mass of roofs, towers, and factory chimneys ; and all round these islands there is as much noisy and dirty shipping as you see in a London river. But as the sun gets stronger, the mist and the smoke disappear, the yellow walls of Bombay shine in the fierce glare, hills are seen on every side,",  "and the sky turns turquoise, the sea turns royal blue, and the air suddenly flashes like a living soul. Once in the streets of Bombay—in spite of its electric trams and motor-cars—the traveller feels that now he is, really and truly, in a new world—a world utterly new and utterly strange. It is not only the extraordinarily vivid glare on the walls of houses, not only the suffocating heat which puts him straight away into a Turkish bath even as he sits perfectly still in his gharry—a shabby little Victoria drawn by a shabby little horse—and it is not only the Eastern character of the architecture and the Indian blue of the sky and the queer appearance of banyan-trees, with their roots banging down from their branches like a girl's brown hair after a swim in the sea ; no, it is not only these things which affect the traveller's mind with a sense of strangeness and difference: the real cause is the people.",  "People like Nero, And Dante, and Caesar, and Some Like English Boys",  "The streets of Bombay are packed and crowded with thousands upon thousands of people, whose complexions, garments, head- gear, as well as their whole manner, suggest a new world. Some are yellow, some are brown, some are black, and some are almost white; some of them wear robes as gorgeous as an emperor's, and some are all but naked; some wear a little twist of cloth on their heads, and some a turban vaster than the hat of the most vulgar woman now in London or Paris ; and some are ferocious to look at, some are gentle as lambs, some are like our idea of Old Testament heroes, some are like Brutus, Nero, Julius Csesar, and Dante, and some are very like English boys conscious of their first stand-up collar and their first walking-stick. Into whatever Indian city the traveller goes he finds the same thing—crowds of people differing from each other in colour, features, expression, dress, language, habits, and religion : people who are more different than Russians from Spaniards, or Germans from Italians, or Britons from Turks. He is confused by all these millions of different Indians, and cannot discover which are the true representatives of the Indian nation. He goes into the bazaars, away from the European quarter, and there sees the real life of an Indian city. The word bazaar stands for a native market street, and these market streets of India are the most interest- ing, perplexing, amusing, and confusing things imaginable.",  "The streets are very narrow, the gaily painted, sun-blistered houses are seldom more than one or two storeys high, and the ground floor, occupied by the shop, is like a costermonger's little barrow or a stall at a country fair. No window obtrudes between the counter and the people on the pavement, and the merchant either squats in the door- way or sits cross-legged on the counter.",  "The Never-Ceasing Multitudes For Ever Moving Past The Shops",  "From side to side the street is thronged by a slow-moving procession of humanity ; everybody appears to be talking at once; nobody seems to want to buy, and nobody seems to want to sell; it looks as if the whole thing were merely a very elaborate 'game of shops,' and as if a number of rather big doll's-houses had been ranged side by side for this purpose.",  "The traveller sees one old bearded mer- chant, a Mussulman, reading his Koran through a pair of worn spectacles, his lips moving and his finger following the print—; reading it there on the counter of his shop, amid piles of brass pots, or carpets, or many-coloured sweetmeats, or rolls of silk. And he sees, among these merchants on their counters or in their doorways, another man praying, and a woman examining her baby's head, and a Hindu merchant having his head shaved, and another puffing con- templatively at his enormous hookah pipe, and another dropping off to sleep with his hands clasped over a vast expanse of girth. And all the time the never-ceasing multi- tudes of chattering people go slowly by, their splendid garments flashing in the bright sunlight, their many-coloured faces assaulted by a host of flies, and their bright eyes and their white teeth shining like diamonds.",  "Every now and then, in the midst of these shops, the traveller sees a wondrously ornate building, often gold-coloured and carved extravagantly, with a flight of steps leading to a dim interior.",  " The Gold-Coloured Temples Of The People Who Would Not Kill A Flea ",  "If, as well he might, the traveller takes one of these buildings for a music-hall, a circus, or the habitation of a cinematograph exhibition, and if he attempts to enter, fumbling in his pocket for a rupee, he will be roughly seized and thrown back into the street, where—as likely as not —a miniature revolution will immediately take place. ",  "For these buildings are Hindu temples, where gods and goddesses are worshipped with a ritual like that of the Roman Catholic Church, and where no wicked infidel of a Christian is ever permitted to set foot. During a festival the very streets in which these temples stand are closed against Europeans, lest a white man should pollute the sacred atmosphere with his degraded breath, and foul the holy ground with his heinous boot-leather. Some of the temples are more or less pretty in appearance, but nearly every one is marred by some repul- sive carving meant to overawe and terrify the worshipper. One of these terrible gods is portrayed with an elephant's head on his shoulders, another is a frightful monkey, and the goddess Kali is represented with skulls and bones for ornaments, with a severed head in her left hand, a fearful, crimson-dyed sword in her right, and such an expression of murderous ferocity on her distorted face as would give a nervous child nightmare for a month of Sundays.",  "The finest of these temples belong to the Jains—pronounced Jynes—a sect of Hindus who are not only vegetarians, but so devoted to all forms of life that they will not even kill the fleas that poison them. They are a dwindling sect, in consequence, a flea- conquered race of humanity, bitten to death without a single scratch in self-defence ; but they are immensely rich, and the fronts of their golden temples make a most striking effect in the bazaars.",  "Then, every here and there, the traveller sees a most imposing building, usually pale blue and white, with a wide flight of stairs leading to the arched entrance, and with minarets shining against the azure of heaven from the roof. These are mosques, where the Mussulmans, followers of Mohammed, worship Allah, the one true and indivisible God. No statues or pictured windows decorate these mosques, nothing which by any stretch of the imagination could be considered a graven image or a possible cause of idolatry, for the Mussulman is descended from Father Abraham, and is like the Israelite of old, who worshipped ",  "one God, in the midst of  innumerable heathens de- voted to idols. So it comes about that the traveller can always dis- tinguish between a temple and a mosque even from the outside, for the one is a mass of carved figures and contorted ornamentation, while the other is plain, simple, austere, and some- times nobly beautiful. ",  "But although the bazaars are the soul of an Indian city they are by no means the soul of India. It is not until the splendid trains of our Indian railways—some of the carriages are fitted with a bath-room—have carried the traveller far away from towns, and not until he has left his wayside station, perhaps in. a bul- lock-cart, and has gone many miles into the open country, that he begins to realise, apprehend, and re- ceive into his own, the real soul of India.",  "How shall I describe to you this soul of India? It is something shy, timorous, wistful, and appealing. It does not greet you with the rugged strength and boisterous self-confidence of Dover Cliff, or with the passionate sweetness of Italian hills, or with the sunburnt cheerfulness of France. It creeps towards you like a spaniel that fears to be scolded and hopes to be caressed. It is a little guilty and ashamed, as though it had stood for ages and ages with its face to the corner, and only now had received permis- sion to turn round and face the world. You cannot say it is beautiful, but you . would be blind of both eyes if you pronounced it dull, ugly, uninteresting. Con- template slowly and thoughtfully this soul of India, and you will say at last that it is the saddest, quietest, gentlest, and most timorous soul in all this world's mysterious geo- graphy.",  "I have been nearly all over India, and never once did I hear Indian children shouting at their play, or see an Indian and his wife walking arm in arm across the fields, or feel one moment's thrill of joy and excitement from all these crowding millions of hu- manity. And this universal spirit of restraint and self- suppression in the people is the very spirit of India's scenery. The plains are almost level, and sometimes are as brown, parched, and arid as the sands of the desert; the jungle for the most part consists of shrubs, scrub, and under- growth ; the tanks—arti- ficial lakes—are wide and beautiful, but sad beyond words ; the rivers, except during the rains, are generally a few trickles of water winding desolately through a vast bed that reminds one of a stone quarry ; the hills are low and gentle, covered with trees, and more or less green ; the mountains, north and south, are wonderfully majestic, and in some parts more lovely far and even more romantic than the mountains of Europe, but they do not seem to belong to India. The real India lies between these mountains, a low-lying, gently undulating, eternally pensive country—a country where no one is in a hurry, no one is excited about anything, and where even the brightest sunshine is destitute of joy. You see the most gorgeous birds in the world, but you hear no such song as rings through our English woodlands. In little England one may go for many miles in the train without seeing a peasant in the fields or a house by the wayside ; in vast and enormous India, wheresoever he may go, the traveller is hardly ever out of sight of a village or of peasants toiling on the land. At the edges of every river he sees half-naked men—an army of them—washing clothes. In the fields he sees colonies of men and women ploughing, sow- ing, and reaping —for all these occupations oc- cur at the same time, just as in the Indian jungle you may see, all at once, trees in spring, summer, and autumn dress, and some bare for winter. And everywhere he sees wells, to which women are moving through the green rice-fields with brazen vessels balanced on their heads, and at which men are working all day with their bullocks. And round the tanks children wait for the buffaloes to come out from the water to be driven back to the homestead. And in the jungle primitive people may be seen moving among the scrub with bows and arrows. And along the highway may always be seen caravans of camels, strings of bullock-carts, a procession °f elephants, a herd of goats, and little groups of pilgrims carrying their sick or their dead to the sacred river and the burning-ground.",  "India is full of movement, but sad move- ment. It is the sorrowful movement of the elephant, not the gay and careless rapture of a colt. Sorrowfully toil the peasants, laboriously move the animals, draggingly creep the children, Only the monkeys seem happy.",  "But enter one of the villages, make yourself pleasant to the people, and straightway you will discover that these quiet and apparently sad Indians are a most winsome and agreeable folk. You will never meet with a more charming courtesy. The humblest peas- ant has the grace of a king, and will receive you with the most ingratiating charm. Forward will come the headman — the mayor of the vil- lage — and, sa- laaming before your honour, will beg you to be seated, will offer you curry and rice on a plantain leaf— you must eat with your fingers —and will offer you a cup of water. He will tell you, if you understand his language, that his bosom swells with pride be- cause you, a great sahib, have come such a long way to see his humble village. And then he will ask questions : Are you one of a large family? Have you much money? What is the price of rice in your part of the world? And something about Queen Victoria. If you admire his baby, and it happens to be a girl, he will beg you to accept it as a present.",  "The houses are built of mud walls, with roofs formed of interlaced palm leaves. Most of them have a verandah, where the men sleep ; the interior, with no furniture, is shared by the women, children, poultry, cattle, and very often a parrot. A Hindu believes that his god becomes annoyed if he is not perpetually praised, and so a parrot is trained to say the god's name and a word or two of adoration ; the Hindu takes it easy while the bird utters this monotonous chant from morning to night.",  "In most villages there is either a temple or a shrine, for to the Hindus religion, is the central business of life. Sometimes they daub a tree or a rock with red paint, and worship that. Just outside many of the villages 1 you will see most curiously shaped camels, horses, or elephants, made of .mud and clay and painted in fantastic colours ; these animals are pro- vided by the villagers for their gods and goddesses, in case the divinities should wish to take a ride. In villages, or quarters of towns and cities, where those people live who are called helots, pariahs, or outcasts— that is to say, the lowest people in India, and there are some 70,000,000 of them— the temple is a very humble mud hovel, and the priests are called ' black priests,' and a real Brahman priest would rather die than speak to one of these black brothers.",  "The Doctor Who Would Let Seventy Million People Perish",  "A caste postman will not give letters into the hands of these outcasts ; he flings them dowm contemptuously at the head of the village street. A caste doctor will not go to them when they are sick; the whole seventy millions might perish before he would go. A Brahman priest will not go to them when they are dying. Until England went to India these poor pariahs were the most wretched and despised people under heaven. But now, slowly and surely, Christianity is converting them into a bold and intelligent democracy.",  "Many temples of great splendour—in a certain sense of the word—are scattered throughout India. Some of them are set on the tops of hills, like our castles in Europe, and look very grand and impressive, flashing all their carving and colouring in the blaze of the sun. The greatest of these temples have entrance gateways in the fashion of Chinese pagodas, painted, as a rule, red and yellow, and they are carved with hideous and repulsive faces.",  "The famous and holy city of Benares is crammed with extraordinary temples. In one you see a white bull feeding on rose petals from a huge golden dish, the pilgrims kneeling on the dirty floor—which is like a foul stable—in worship and adoration. In another temple you fancy yourself in the monkey-house of the Zoological Gardens, for it is alive with sacred monkeys chasing the pilgrims for food. To the Mussulman all this is disgusting, revolting, and blasphe- mous ; but the Mussulmans are 70,000,000, and the Hindus are 230,000,000. In spite of this great disparity in numbers, however, the Mussulmans would make holy war against the Hindus but for the Pax Britannica—or 'British Peace'—as we call the peace maintained by the British Government.",  "Perhaps The Most Perfect Building On Earth",  "It is in the old cities of India that you see the most glorious buildings and the most beautiful architecture. In Agra, for instance, you breathe the very air of the great Mogul Empire, and the mosques of Islam there and in Delhi surpass in the sweet dignity of their refined beauty any- thing that we possess in Europe. The marble floors, walls, and roofs are cut to represent flowers, and inlaid with precious stones. Some of the panels are carved and pierced so that they look like fret- work. In the palace of Shah Jehan at Agra there is one of these beautiful panels so cunningly carved that while people inside can look through and see everything, the person on the other side can see nothing at all of the interior. The Taj Mahal at Agra, standing in a cypress garden on the banks of the Jumna, is perhaps the most perfect building on this earth ; it is the tomb built by Shah Jehan for his faithful wife, and there he and she now lie in tombs of marble, very beautifully asleep. Often, surely, the Mussulmans who visit these exquisite and superb creations of their dead emperors must look with questioning eyes and rebellious hearts at the hideous red-brick barns which we erect to God, and which, sometimes, we fill with statues and images and symbols, which the Mussulman regards as the abomination of idolatry.",  "The Splendid Work that England is Doing for India",  "But England is doing something more than setting up these ugly churches. She is turning the rivers here and there, so that waste deserts, where no man ever lived before, now hold a million families who thrive exceedingly. She is also setting up immense factories, laying railway lines in every direction, building hospitals and schools, delving deep into the earth for coal and silver, improving agriculture, keeping the peace, withstanding the tyrant, and commanding equal justice for rich and poor. And readers of this magazine rejoice to know that more and more the League of the Helping Hand is growing in India, where we have now eleven bands.",  "So perhaps it is only a few dreamers who look back with regret on the days of the Great Moguls, days of hideous tyranny and incessant war, days of fiendish cruelty, assassination, murder, torture, and brutality. Children are now taught to read, and write, the lowest outcast can enter a Government hospital, and the meanest peasant can claim justice from the proudest Brahman.",  "And India is waking up. Quietly and without excitement she is putting back the blankets of custom, raising her head from the pillow of superstition, and looking with slowly opening eyes towards the new sun of freedom and enterprise. The traveller finds nearly all the comforts of Europe in the new cities. The hotels have lifts, electric lights, bath-rooms, and French cooks. There is a proper water-supply and system of drainage. Indians have their clubs, and play cricket, polo, and tennis. At almost every railway station there is a good refreshment- room, and a large waiting-room fitted with lounges and armchairs, where a traveller may pass the night and take a bath in the morn- ing free of charge. And though things are rather dearer than they used to be, a man may still live luxuriously in India on money that would render life hard and troublesome in England. The peasant keeps a family on twopence a day ; the factory hand is rich with fivepence a day ; and the schoolmaster is a Croesus with sixteen shillings a month.",  "Beautiful, if wistful and sad, is this great empire of India ; and though it takes most Englishmen a little time to accustom them- selves to the burning sun and incessant glare, it is a country where our people live noble lives and are so happy that many of them settle there even when they have pensions enough to come home."]
