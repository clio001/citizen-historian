            <p>Edited by Mark A. Allen (2021)</p>
            
            <p class="text-start text-67">The boom of the Second Industrial Revolution in America from 1870 through to 1920, markedly transformed the ways Americans related to the environment, from how they used it and worked with it to how they thought about it. During this fifty-year period, employment in American Manufacturing grew to 4.5 times its original force, from 2.5 million Americans employed to roughly 11.5 million, bringing with it an increase in labor power, and a demand for materials and energy as well. Public sentiments on nature and the environment of America also shifted in this era. Through the contributions of countless passionate Americans, including the storied writer Mark Twain, the photographer William Henry Jackson, the frontier historian Fredrick Jackson Turner, and the naturalists Anna Botsford Comstock and John Muir, conservationist thought began to take shape.</p>
            
            <p class="text-start text-67">These seemingly conflicting concepts of industry and nature came together in Fox River, Wisconsin on August 20, 1882, when Henry J. Rogers&#39;s Appleton Edison Light Company switched on the first ever hydroelectric generator. With an output of around fifty watts of power, and the capability of powering nearly 250 incandescent lightbulbs, its opening cemented Fox River in both industrial and environmental history. Not only was this a landmark moment for a novel use of natural resources to generate power, but it also set the stage for future adoption by the industrial sector. Similar hydro turbine generators were created to power a variety of amenities, from streetlights in Niagara, New York, to theatrical performances in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The advent of alternating current systems during the 1880s made possible the creation of the first ever Hydropower plant, Redlands Power Plant, which opened in California in 1893.</p>
            
            <p class="text-start text-67">Not until the years between 1917 and 1920 did this promising method of environmentally friendly power generation gain traction with the American government. The Federal Government&#39;s turn towards conservationism began with President Theodor Roosevelt, an avid outdoorsman. He had pushed for the creation of fifty-one wildlife refuges and five national parks with numerous other conservation acts before his presidency&#39;s end in 1909. President William Howard Taft continued these policies, but it was President Woodrow Wilson who signed the first law regulating and promoting hydroelectric power generation. On June 10, 1920 Wilson, a historian, free market Liberal, and economic moralist, signed into law the Federal Power Act which had been passed by the Sixty-Sixth Congress. This Act led to the creation of the Federal Power Commission, a governmental agency which counts more than 90 years of service today. The Act also regulated hydroelectric power and furthered the creation of hydropower plants around the United States by the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
