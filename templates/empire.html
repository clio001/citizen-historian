                <p class="text-67">The exhibition, “British Empire for Children,” features ten excerpts from entries
                    published in The
                    Children’s
                    Encyclopaedia (or one of its other titles) between 1908 and 1913. The entries chosen focus on
                    regions that were formal
                    British crown colonies, spheres of influence, or other world regions often imagined through a
                    colonialist lens in the
                    decade before the First World War.</p>
                <p class="text-67">
                    Each excerpt is contextualized in an editorial note and a further reading list researched and
                    written by undergraduate
                    history students from Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts, USA. The documents are further
                    transcribed using the
                    XML-standard as set out by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and enriched with metadata information
                    to support
                    data-driven analysis.</p>

                        In 1908, journalist Arthur Mee (1875-1943) launched his children’s encyclopedia series, which
                        became
                        one
                        of the most
                        beloved and successful works for children in the Anglophone world. Under its first title, The
                        Children’s
                        Encyclopaedia,
                        the series sold 1.5 million sets across the British Empire, becoming a fixture in both home and
                        school
                        libraries. The
                        American edition of the encyclopedia, The Book of Knowledge, sold a further 3.5 million sets.
                        Subsequent
                        editions sold
                        additional copies under various names, including The New Children’s Encyclopaedia (1910-1911),
                        the
                        Children’s Magazine
                        (1911-1913), and the long-running Children’s Newspaper (1919-1964).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-67">

                        The contents of Mee’s encyclopedic volumes ranged across many subjects of knowledge from
                        gardening,
                        natural science, and
                        engineering to history, poetry, and literature. Colonialist themes feature prominently
                        throughout
                        the
                        series, especially
                        in the geography and biography sections. Mee aimed for the encyclopedia to “build up the men and
                        women
                        who will rule our
                        Empire in the years to come.” In its pages, he also promoted an organization for boys and girls
                        that
                        he
                        dubbed The
                        League of the Helping Hand, which he hoped would build bonds of youthful friendship throughout
                        and
                        beyond the British
                        Empire. While Mee wrote many of the entries, numerous other attributed or unattributed authors
                        also
                        contributed pieces.</p>

                    <p class="text-67"> Mee’s role as chief editor ensured that his biography and personality shaped the
                        editorial outlook
                        of
                        The
                        Children’s Encyclopaedia. He was born in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire in 1875 to a family of
                        lacemakers
                        whose social
                        status stood precariously between the working and the lower middle classes. His upbringing was
                        deeply
                        influenced by his
                        father’s activist liberal politics and nonconformist Baptist religion. Mee moved to London in
                        1897,
                        where he married and
                        became a successful journalist. In the debates of early twentieth century Britain, he described
                        his
                        politics as liberal
                        or radical. His religious upbringing ensured that The Children’s Encyclopedia reflected a
                        nonconformist
                        Protestant
                        worldview. Mee was also a staunch colonialist. Positive views of the British Empire pervade his
                        life
                        and
                        work; he
                        consistently held that British power was a tool of humanitarianism and progress in the broader
                        world.
                        Like most
                        imperialists of his generation, however, his views of empire and indigenous peoples were
                        influenced
                        by
                        Social Darwinism,
                        eugenics, and cultural racism. By the time Mee died in 1943, his encyclopedia series had made
                        him a
                        well-known childhood
                        figure for generations of children in the English-speaking world.</p>
